2                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            And he spake unto them concerning their rebellions upon the waters, and the mercies of God in sparing their lives, that they were not swallowed up in the sea.

5                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     But, said he, notwithstanding our afflictions, we have obtained a land of promise, a land which is choice above all other lands; a land which the Lord God hath covenanted with me should be a land for the inheritance of my seed. Yea, the Lord hath covenanted this land unto me, and to my children forever, and also all those who should be led out of other countries by the hand of the Lord.
6                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        Wherefore, I, Lehi, prophesy according to the workings of the Spirit which is in me, that there shall none come into this land save they shall be brought by the hand of the Lord.
7                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Wherefore, this land is consecrated unto him whom he shall bring. And if it so be that they shall serve him according to the commandments which he hath given, it shall be a land of liberty unto them; wherefore, they shall never be brought down into captivity; if so, it shall be because of iniquity; for if iniquity shall abound cursed shall be the land for their sakes, but unto the righteous it shall be blessed forever.
8                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      And behold, it is wisdom that this land should be kept as yet from the knowledge of other nations; for behold, many nations would overrun the land, that there would be no place for an inheritance.
9                                                                                                                                           Wherefore, I, Lehi, have obtained a promise, that inasmuch as those whom the Lord God shall bring out of the land of Jerusalem shall keep his commandments, they shall prosper upon the face of this land; and they shall be kept from all other nations, that they may possess this land unto themselves. And if it so be that they shall keep his commandments they shall be blessed upon the face of this land, and there shall be none to molest them, nor to take away the land of their inheritance; and they shall dwell safely forever.
10  But behold, when the time cometh that they shall dwindle in unbelief, after they have received so great blessings from the hand of the Lord--having a knowledge of the creation of the earth, and all men, knowing the great and marvelous works of the Lord from the creation of the world; having power given them to do all things by faith; having all the commandments from the beginning, and having been brought by his infinite goodness into this precious land of promise--behold, I say, if the day shall come that they will reject the Holy One of Israel, the true Messiah, their Redeemer and their God, behold, the judgments of him that is just shall rest upon them.

12                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             Yea, as one generation passeth to another there shall be bloodsheds, and great visitations among them; wherefore, my sons, I would that ye would remember; yea, I would that ye would hearken unto my words.
13                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              O that ye would awake; awake from a deep sleep, yea, even from the sleep of hell, and shake off the awful chains by which ye are bound, which are the chains which bind the children of men, that they are carried away captive down to the eternal gulf of misery and woe.
14                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         Awake! and arise from the dust, and hear the words of a trembling parent, whose limbs ye must soon lay down in the cold and silent grave, from whence no traveler can return; a few more days and I go the way of all the earth.
15                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               But behold, the Lord hath redeemed my soul from hell; I have beheld his glory, and I am encircled about eternally in the arms of his love.
16                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            And I desire that ye should remember to observe the statutes and the judgments of the Lord; behold, this hath been the anxiety of my soul from the beginning.
17                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 My heart hath been weighed down with sorrow from time to time, for I have feared, lest for the hardness of your hearts the Lord your God should come out in the fulness of his wrath upon you, that ye be cut off and destroyed forever;
18                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      Or, that a cursing should come upon you for the space of many generations; and ye are visited by sword, and by famine, and are hated, and are led according to the will and captivity of the devil.
19                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              O my sons, that these things might not come upon you, but that ye might be a choice and a favored people of the Lord. But behold, his will be done; for his ways are righteousness forever.
20                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    And he hath said that: Inasmuch as ye shall keep my commandments ye shall prosper in the land; but inasmuch as ye will not keep my commandments ye shall be cut off from my presence.
21                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        And now that my soul might have joy in you, and that my heart might leave this world with gladness because of you, that I might not be brought down with grief and sorrow to the grave, arise from the dust, my sons, and be men, and be determined in one mind and in one heart, united in all things, that ye may not come down into captivity;
22                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         That ye may not be cursed with a sore cursing; and also, that ye may not incur the displeasure of a just God upon you, unto the destruction, yea, the eternal destruction of both soul and body.
23                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               Awake, my sons; put on the armor of righteousness. Shake off the chains with which ye are bound, and come forth out of obscurity, and arise from the dust.
24                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      Rebel no more against your brother, whose views have been glorious, and who hath kept the commandments from the time that we left Jerusalem; and who hath been an instrument in the hands of God, in bringing us forth into the land of promise; for were it not for him, we must have perished with hunger in the wilderness; nevertheless, ye sought to take away his life; yea, and he hath suffered much sorrow because of you.
25                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      And I exceedingly fear and tremble because of you, lest he shall suffer again; for behold, ye have accused him that he sought power and authority over you; but I know that he hath not sought for power nor authority over you, but he hath sought the glory of God, and your own eternal welfare.
26                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         And ye have murmured because he hath been plain unto you. Ye say that he hath used sharpness; ye say that he hath been angry with you; but behold, his sharpness was the sharpness of the power of the word of God, which was in him; and that which ye call anger was the truth, according to that which is in God, which he could not restrain, manifesting boldly concerning your iniquities.
27                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               And it must needs be that the power of God must be with him, even unto his commanding you that ye must obey. But behold, it was not he, but it was the Spirit of the Lord which was in him, which opened his mouth to utterance that he could not shut it.
28                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          And now my son, Laman, and also Lemuel and Sam, and also my sons who are the sons of Ishmael, behold, if ye will hearken unto the voice of Nephi ye shall not perish. And if ye will hearken unto him I leave unto you a blessing, yea, even my first blessing.
29                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    But if ye will not hearken unto him I take away my first blessing, yea, even my blessing, and it shall rest upon him.
30                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          And now, Zoram, I speak unto you: Behold, thou art the servant of Laban; nevertheless, thou hast been brought out of the land of Jerusalem, and I know that thou art a true friend unto my son, Nephi, forever.
31                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         Wherefore, because thou hast been faithful thy seed shall be blessed with his seed, that they dwell in prosperity long upon the face of this land; and nothing, save it shall be iniquity among them, shall harm or disturb their prosperity upon the face of this land forever.
32                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      Wherefore, if ye shall keep the commandments of the Lord, the Lord hath consecrated this land for the security of thy seed with the seed of my son.
33                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          And now, Jacob, I speak unto you: Thou art my first-born in the days of my tribulation in the wilderness. And behold, in thy childhood thou hast suffered afflictions and much sorrow, because of the rudeness of thy brethren.
34                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         Nevertheless, Jacob, my first-born in the wilderness, thou knowest the greatness of God; and he shall consecrate thine afflictions for thy gain.
35                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        Wherefore, thy soul shall be blessed, and thou shalt dwell safely with thy brother, Nephi; and thy days shall be spent in the service of thy God. Wherefore, I know that thou art redeemed, because of the righteousness of thy Redeemer; for thou hast beheld that in the fulness of time he cometh to bring salvation unto men.
36                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          And thou hast beheld in thy youth his glory; wherefore, thou art blessed even as they unto whom he shall minister in the flesh; for the Spirit is the same, yesterday, today, and forever. And the way is prepared from the fall of man, and salvation is free.
37                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    And men are instructed sufficiently that they know good from evil. And the law is given unto men. And by the law no flesh is justified; or, by the law men are cut off. Yea, by the temporal law they were cut off; and also, by the spiritual law they perish from that which is good, and become miserable forever.
38                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         Wherefore, redemption cometh in and through the Holy Messiah; for he is full of grace and truth.
39                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Behold, he offereth himself a sacrifice for sin, to answer the ends of the law, unto all those who have a broken heart and a contrite spirit; and unto none else can the ends of the law be answered.
40                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Wherefore, how great the importance to make these things known unto the inhabitants of the earth, that they may know that there is no flesh that can dwell in the presence of God, save it be through the merits, and mercy, and grace of the Holy Messiah, who layeth down his life according to the flesh, and taketh it again by the power of the Spirit, that he may bring to pass the resurrection of the dead, being the first that should rise.
41                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              Wherefore, he is the firstfruits unto God, inasmuch as he shall make intercession for all the children of men; and they that believe in him shall be saved.
42                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          And because of the intercession for all, all men come unto God; wherefore, they stand in the presence of him, to be judged of him according to the truth and holiness which is in him. Wherefore, the ends of the law which the Holy One hath given, unto the inflicting of the punishment which is affixed, which punishment that is affixed is in opposition to that of the happiness which is affixed, to answer the ends of the atonement--
43                                                                                                                                                                                                           For it must needs be, that there is an opposition in all things. If not so, my first-born in the wilderness, righteousness could not be brought to pass, neither wickedness, neither holiness nor misery, neither good nor bad. Wherefore, all things must needs be a compound in one; wherefore, if it should be one body it must needs remain as dead, having no life neither death, nor corruption nor incorruption, happiness nor misery, neither sense nor insensibility.
44                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 Wherefore, it must needs have been created for a thing of naught; wherefore there would have been no purpose in the end of its creation. Wherefore, this thing must needs destroy the wisdom of God and his eternal purposes, and also the power, and the mercy, and the justice of God.
45                                                                                                                                                  And if ye shall say there is no law, ye shall also say there is no sin. If ye shall say there is no sin, ye shall also say there is no righteousness. And if there be no righteousness there be no happiness. And if there be no righteousness nor happiness there be no punishment nor misery. And if these things are not there is no God. And if there is no God we are not, neither the earth; for there could have been no creation of things, neither to act nor to be acted upon; wherefore, all things must have vanished away.
46                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       And now, my sons, I speak unto you these things for your profit and learning; for there is a God, and he hath created all things, both the heavens and the earth, and all things that in them are, both things to act and things to be acted upon.
47                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 And to bring about his eternal purposes in the end of man, after he had created our first parents, and the beasts of the field and the fowls of the air, and in fine, all things which are created, it must needs be that there was an opposition; even the forbidden fruit in opposition to the tree of life; the one being sweet and the other bitter.
48                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            Wherefore, the Lord God gave unto man that he should act for himself. Wherefore, man could not act for himself save it should be that he was enticed by the one or the other.
49                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 And I, Lehi, according to the things which I have read, must needs suppose that an angel of God, according to that which is written, had fallen from heaven; wherefore, he became a devil, having sought that which was evil before God.
50                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     And because he had fallen from heaven, and had become miserable forever, he sought also the misery of all mankind. Wherefore, he said unto Eve, yea, even that old serpent, who is the devil, who is the father of all lies, wherefore he said: Partake of the forbidden fruit, and ye shall not die, but ye shall be as God, knowing good and evil.
51                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                And after Adam and Eve had partaken of the forbidden fruit they were driven out of the garden of Eden, to till the earth.
52                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             And they have brought forth children; yea, even the family of all the earth.
53                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         And the days of the children of men were prolonged, according to the will of God, that they might repent while in the flesh; wherefore, their state became a state of probation, and their time was lengthened, according to the commandments which the Lord God gave unto the children of men. For he gave commandment that all men must repent; for he showed unto all men that they were lost, because of the transgression of their parents.
54                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        And now, behold, if Adam had not transgressed he would not have fallen, but he would have remained in the garden of Eden. And all things which were created must have remained in the same state in which they were after they were created; and they must have remained forever, and had no end.
55                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            And they would have had no children; wherefore they would have remained in a state of innocence, having no joy, for they knew no misery; doing no good, for they knew no sin.
56                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       But behold, all things have been done in the wisdom of him who knoweth all things.
57                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      Adam fell that men might be; and men are, that they might have joy.
58                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      And the Messiah cometh in the fulness of time, that he may redeem the children of men from the fall. And because that they are redeemed from the fall they have become free forever, knowing good from evil; to act for themselves and not to be acted upon, save it be by the punishment of the law at the great and last day, according to the commandments which God hath given.
59                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          Wherefore, men are free according to the flesh; and all things are given them which are expedient unto man. And they are free to choose liberty and eternal life, through the great Mediator of all men, or to choose captivity and death, according to the captivity and power of the devil; for he seeketh that all men might be miserable like unto himself.

61                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       And not choose eternal death, according to the will of the flesh and the evil which is therein, which giveth the spirit of the devil power to captivate, to bring you down to hell, that he may reign over you in his own kingdom.
62                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      I have spoken these few words unto you all, my sons, in the last days of my probation; and I have chosen the good part, according to the words of the prophet. And I have none other object save it be the everlasting welfare of your souls. Amen.
63                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   And now I speak unto you, Joseph, my last-born. Thou wast born in the wilderness of mine afflictions; yea, in the days of my greatest sorrow did thy mother bear thee.
64                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       And may the Lord consecrate also unto thee this land, which is a most precious land, for thine inheritance and the inheritance of thy seed with thy brethren, for thy security forever, if it so be that ye shall keep the commandments of the Holy One of Israel.
65                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              And now, Joseph, my last-born, whom I have brought out of the wilderness of mine afflictions, may the Lord bless thee forever, for thy seed shall not utterly be destroyed.
66                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      For behold, thou art the fruit of my loins; and I am a descendant of Joseph who was carried captive into Egypt. And great were the covenants of the Lord which he made unto Joseph.
67                                                                                                                                                        Wherefore, Joseph truly saw our day. And he obtained a promise of the Lord, that out of the fruit of his loins the Lord God would raise up a righteous branch unto the house of Israel; not the Messiah, but a branch which was to be broken off, nevertheless, to be remembered in the covenants of the Lord that the Messiah should be made manifest unto them in the latter days, in the spirit of power, unto the bringing of them out of darkness unto light--yea, out of hidden darkness and out of captivity unto freedom.
68                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        For Joseph truly testified, saying: A seer shall the Lord my God raise up, who shall be a choice seer unto the fruit of my loins.
69                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Yea, Joseph truly said: Thus saith the Lord unto me: A choice seer will I raise up out of the fruit of thy loins; and he shall be esteemed highly among the fruit of thy loins. And unto him will I give commandment that he shall do a work for the fruit of thy loins, his brethren, which shall be of great worth unto them, even to the bringing of them to the knowledge of the covenants which I have made with thy fathers.
70                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       And I will give unto him a commandment that he shall do none other work, save the work which I shall command him. And I will make him great in mine eyes; for he shall do my work.
71                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              And he shall be great like unto Moses, whom I have said I would raise up unto you, to deliver my people, O house of Israel.
72                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               And Moses will I raise up, to deliver thy people out of the land of Egypt.
73                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           But a seer will I raise up out of the fruit of thy loins; and unto him will I give power to bring forth my word unto the seed of thy loins--and not to the bringing forth my word only, saith the Lord, but to the convincing them of my word, which shall have already gone forth among them.
74                                                                                                                                                                 Wherefore, the fruit of thy loins shall write; and the fruit of the loins of Judah shall write; and that which shall be written by the fruit of thy loins, and also that which shall be written by the fruit of the loins of Judah, shall grow together, unto the confounding of false doctrines and laying down of contentions, and establishing peace among the fruit of thy loins, and bringing them to the knowledge of their fathers in the latter days, and also to the knowledge of my covenants, saith the Lord.
75                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    And out of weakness he shall be made strong, in that day when my work shall commence among all my people, unto the restoring thee, O house of Israel, saith the Lord.
76                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                And thus prophesied Joseph, saying: Behold, that seer will the Lord bless; and they that seek to destroy him shall be confounded; for this promise, which I have obtained of the Lord, of the fruit of my loins, shall be fulfilled. Behold, I am sure of the fulfilling of this promise;
77                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           And his name shall be called after me; and it shall be after the name of his father. And he shall be like unto me; for the thing, which the Lord shall bring forth by his hand, by the power of the Lord shall bring my people unto salvation.
78                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Yea, thus prophesied Joseph: I am sure of this thing, even as I am sure of the promise of Moses; for the Lord hath said unto me, I will preserve thy seed forever.
79                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    And the Lord hath said: I will raise up a Moses; and I will give power unto him in a rod; and I will give judgment unto him in writing. Yet I will not loose his tongue, that he shall speak much, for I will not make him mighty in speaking. But I will write unto him my law, by the finger of mine own hand; and I will make a spokesman for him.
80                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           And the Lord said unto me also: I will raise up unto the fruit of thy loins; and I will make for him a spokesman. And I, behold, I will give unto him that he shall write the writing of the fruit of thy loins, unto the fruit of thy loins; and the spokesman of thy loins shall declare it.
81                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              And the words which he shall write shall be the words which are expedient in my wisdom should go forth unto the fruit of thy loins. And it shall be as if the fruit of thy loins had cried unto them from the dust; for I know their faith.
82                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           And they shall cry from the dust; yea, even repentance unto their brethren, even after many generations have gone by them. And it shall come to pass that their cry shall go, even according to the simpleness of their words.
83                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         Because of their faith their words shall proceed forth out of my mouth unto their brethren who are the fruit of thy loins; and the weakness of their words will I make strong in their faith, unto the remembering of my covenant which I made unto thy fathers.
84                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         And now, behold, my son Joseph, after this manner did my father of old prophesy.
85                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            Wherefore, because of this covenant thou art blessed; for thy seed shall not be destroyed, for they shall hearken unto the words of the book.
86                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    And there shall rise up one mighty among them, who shall do much good, both in word and in deed, being an instrument in the hands of God, with exceeding faith, to work mighty wonders, and do that thing which is great in the sight of God, unto the bringing to pass much restoration unto the house of Israel, and unto the seed of thy brethren.
87                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        And now, blessed art thou, Joseph. Behold, thou art little; wherefore hearken unto the words of thy brother, Nephi, and it shall be done unto thee even according to the words which I have spoken. Remember the words of thy dying father. Amen.
88                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        And now, I, Nephi, speak concerning the prophecies of which my father hath spoken, concerning Joseph, who was carried into Egypt.
89                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      For behold, he truly prophesied concerning all his seed. And the prophecies which he wrote, there are not many greater. And he prophesied concerning us, and our future generations; and they are written upon the plates of brass.

93                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                Wherefore, if ye are cursed, behold, I leave my blessing upon you, that the cursing may be taken from you and be answered upon the heads of your parents.
94                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 Wherefore, because of my blessing the Lord God will not suffer that ye shall perish; wherefore, he will be merciful unto you and unto your seed forever.

96                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            And he spake unto them, saying: Behold, my sons and my daughters, who are the sons and the daughters of my second son; behold I leave unto you the same blessing which I left unto the sons and daughters of Laman; wherefore, thou shalt not utterly be destroyed; but in the end thy seed shall be blessed.
97                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               And it came to pass that when my father had made an end of speaking unto them, behold, he spake unto the sons of Ishmael, yea, and even all his household.
98                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      And after he had made an end of speaking unto them, he spake unto Sam, saying: Blessed art thou, and thy seed; for thou shalt inherit the land like unto thy brother Nephi. And thy seed shall be numbered with his seed; and thou shalt be even like unto thy brother, and thy seed like unto his seed; and thou shalt be blessed in all thy days.
99                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        And it came to pass after my father, Lehi, had spoken unto all his household, according to the feelings of his heart and the Spirit of the Lord which was in him, he waxed old. And it came to pass that he died, and was buried.

101                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            For I, Nephi, was constrained to speak unto them, according to his word; for I had spoken many things unto them, and also my father, before his death; many of which sayings are written upon mine other plates; for a more history part are written upon mine other plates.
102                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           And upon these I write the things of my soul, and many of the scriptures which are engraven upon the plates of brass. For my soul delighteth in the scriptures, and my heart pondereth them, and writeth them for the learning and the profit of my children.
103                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Behold, my soul delighteth in the things of the Lord; and my heart pondereth continually upon the things which I have seen and heard.
104                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Nevertheless, notwithstanding the great goodness of the Lord, in showing me his great and marvelous works, my heart exclaimeth: O wretched man that I am! Yea, my heart sorroweth because of my flesh; my soul grieveth because of mine iniquities.

111                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            And by day have I waxed bold in mighty prayer before him; yea, my voice have I sent up on high; and angels came down and ministered unto me.
112                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              And upon the wings of his Spirit hath my body been carried away upon exceedingly high mountains. And mine eyes have beheld great things, yea, even too great for man; therefore I was bidden that I should not write them.
113                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                O then, if I have seen so great things, if the Lord in his condescension unto the children of men hath visited men in so much mercy, why should my heart weep and my soul linger in the valley of sorrow, and my flesh waste away, and my strength slacken, because of mine afflictions?
114                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  And why should I yield to sin, because of my flesh? Yea, why should I give way to temptations, that the evil one have place in my heart to destroy my peace and afflict my soul? Why am I angry because of mine enemy?
115                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           Awake, my soul! No longer droop in sin. Rejoice, O my heart, and give place no more for the enemy of my soul.
116                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Do not anger again because of mine enemies. Do not slacken my strength because of mine afflictions.
117                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Rejoice, O my heart, and cry unto the Lord, and say: O Lord, I will praise thee forever; yea, my soul will rejoice in thee, my God, and the rock of my salvation.

Wilt thou deliver me out of the hands of mine enemies? Wilt thou make me that I may shake at the appearance of sin?
119                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             May the gates of hell be shut continually before me, because that my heart is broken and my spirit is contrite! O Lord, wilt thou not shut the gates of thy righteousness before me, that I may walk in the path of the low valley, that I may be strict in the plain road!
120                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 O Lord, wilt thou encircle me around in the robe of thy righteousness! O Lord, wilt thou make a way for mine escape before mine enemies! Wilt thou make my path straight before me! Wilt thou not place a stumbling block in my way--but that thou wouldst clear my way before me, and hedge not up my way, but the ways of mine enemy.
121                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        O Lord, I have trusted in thee, and I will trust in thee forever. I will not put my trust in the arm of flesh; for I know that cursed is he that putteth his trust in the arm of flesh. Yea, cursed is he that putteth his trust in man or maketh flesh his arm.
122                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Yea, I know that God will give liberally to him that asketh. Yea, my God will give me, if I ask not amiss; therefore I will lift up my voice unto thee; yea, I will cry unto thee, my God, the rock of my righteousness. Behold, my voice shall forever ascend up unto thee, my rock and mine everlasting God. Amen.
123                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          Behold, it came to pass that I, Nephi, did cry much unto the Lord my God, because of the anger of my brethren.
124                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      But behold, their anger did increase against me, insomuch that they did seek to take away my life.
125                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 Yea, they did murmur against me, saying: Our younger brother thinks to rule over us; and we have had much trial because of him; wherefore, now let us slay him, that we may not be afflicted more because of his words. For behold, we will not have him to be our ruler; for it belongs unto us, who are the elder brethren, to rule over this people.
126                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 Now I do not write upon these plates all the words which they murmured against me. But it sufficeth me to say, that they did seek to take away my life.
127                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 And it came to pass that the Lord did warn me, that I, Nephi, should depart from them and flee into the wilderness, and all those who would go with me.
128                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          Wherefore, it came to pass that I, Nephi, did take my family, and also Zoram and his family, and Sam, mine elder brother and his family, and Jacob and Joseph, my younger brethren, and also my sisters, and all those who would go with me. And all those who would go with me were those who believed in the warnings and the revelations of God; wherefore, they did hearken unto my words.
129                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       And we did take our tents and whatsoever things were possible for us, and did journey in the wilderness for the space of many days. And after we had journeyed for the space of many days we did pitch our tents.
130                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   And my people would that we should call the name of the place Nephi; wherefore, we did call it Nephi.
131                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               And all those who were with me did take upon them to call themselves the people of Nephi.
132                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              And we did observe to keep the judgments, and the statutes, and the commandments of the Lord in all things, according to the law of Moses.
133                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  And the Lord was with us; and we did prosper exceedingly; for we did sow seed, and we did reap again in abundance. And we began to raise flocks, and herds, and animals of every kind.
134                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   And I, Nephi, had also brought the records which were engraven upon the plates of brass; and also the ball, or compass, which was prepared for my father by the hand of the Lord, according to that which is written.
135                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  And it came to pass that we began to prosper exceedingly, and to multiply in the land.
136                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      And I, Nephi, did take the sword of Laban, and after the manner of it did make many swords, lest by any means the people who were now called Lamanites should come upon us and destroy us; for I knew their hatred towards me and my children and those who were called my people.
137                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               And I did teach my people to build buildings, and to work in all manner of wood, and of iron, and of copper, and of brass, and of steel, and of gold, and of silver, and of precious ores, which were in great abundance.
138                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               And I, Nephi, did build a temple; and I did construct it after the manner of the temple of Solomon save it were not built of so many precious things; for they were not to be found upon the land, wherefore, it could not be built like unto Solomon's temple. But the manner of the construction was like unto the temple of Solomon; and the workmanship thereof was exceedingly fine.
139                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                And it came to pass that I, Nephi, did cause my people to be industrious, and to labor with their hands.
140                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        And it came to pass that they would that I should be their king. But I, Nephi, was desirous that they should have no king; nevertheless, I did for them according to that which was in my power.
141                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 And behold, the words of the Lord had been fulfilled unto my brethren, which he spake concerning them, that I should be their ruler and their teacher. Wherefore, I had been their ruler and their teacher, according to the commandments of the Lord, until the time they sought to take away my life.
142                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               Wherefore, the word of the Lord was fulfilled which he spake unto me, saying that: Inasmuch as they will not hearken unto thy words they shall be cut off from the presence of the Lord. And behold, they were cut off from his presence.
143                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 And he had caused the cursing to come upon them, yea, even a sore cursing, because of their iniquity. For behold, they had hardened their hearts against him, that they had become like unto a flint; wherefore, as they were white, and exceedingly fair and delightsome, that they might not be enticing unto my people the Lord God did cause a skin of blackness to come upon them.
144                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     And thus saith the Lord God: I will cause that they shall be loathsome unto thy people, save they shall repent of their iniquities.

And the Lord spake it, and it was done.

147                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        And the Lord God said unto me: They shall be a scourge unto thy seed, to stir them up in remembrance of me; and inasmuch as they will not remember me, and hearken unto my words, they shall scourge them even unto destruction.
148                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                And it came to pass that I, Nephi, did consecrate Jacob and Joseph, that they should be priests and teachers over the land of my people.
149                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        And it came to pass that we lived after the manner of happiness.

151                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             And I, Nephi, had kept the records upon my plates, which I had made, of my people thus far.
152                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          And it came to pass that the Lord God said unto me: Make other plates; and thou shalt engraven many things upon them which are good in my sight, for the profit of thy people.
153                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                Wherefore, I, Nephi, to be obedient to the commandments of the Lord, went and made these plates upon which I have engraven these things.
154                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              And I engraved that which is pleasing unto God. And if my people are pleased with the things of God they will be pleased with mine engravings which are upon these plates.
155                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                And if my people desire to know the more particular part of the history of my people they must search mine other plates.
156                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             And it sufficeth me to say that forty years had passed away, and we had already had wars and contentions with our brethren.
157                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      The words of Jacob, the brother of Nephi, which he spake unto the people of Nephi:
158                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Behold, my beloved brethren, I, Jacob, having been called of God, and ordained after the manner of his holy order, and having been consecrated by my brother Nephi, unto whom ye look as a king or a protector, and on whom ye depend for safety, behold ye know that I have spoken unto you exceedingly many things.
159                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  Nevertheless, I speak unto you again; for I am desirous for the welfare of your souls. Yea, mine anxiety is great for you; and ye yourselves know that it ever has been. For I have exhorted you with all diligence; and I have taught you the words of my father; and I have spoken unto you concerning all things which are written, from the creation of the world.
160                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  And now, behold, I would speak unto you concerning things which are, and which are to come; wherefore, I will read you the words of Isaiah. And they are the words which my brother has desired that I should speak unto you. And I speak unto you for your sakes, that ye may learn and glorify the name of your God.
161                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      And now, the words which I shall read are they which Isaiah spake concerning all the house of Israel; wherefore, they may be likened unto you, for ye are of the house of Israel. And there are many things which have been spoken by Isaiah which may be likened unto you, because ye are of the house of Israel.
162                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    And now, these are the words: Thus saith the Lord God: Behold, I will lift up mine hand to the Gentiles, and set up my standard to the people; and they shall bring thy sons in their arms, and thy daughters shall be carried upon their shoulders.
163                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 And kings shall be thy nursing fathers, and their queens thy nursing mothers; they shall bow down to thee with their faces towards the earth, and lick up the dust of thy feet; and thou shalt know that I am the Lord; for they shall not be ashamed that wait for me.
164                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       And now I, Jacob, would speak somewhat concerning these words. For behold, the Lord has shown me that those who were at Jerusalem, from whence we came, have been slain and carried away captive.
165                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                Nevertheless, the Lord has shown unto me that they should return again. And he also has shown unto me that the Lord God, the Holy One of Israel, should manifest himself unto them in the flesh; and after he should manifest himself they should scourge him and crucify him, according to the words of the angel who spake it unto me.
166                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  And after they have hardened their hearts and stiffened their necks against the Holy One of Israel, behold, the judgments of the Holy One of Israel shall come upon them. And the day cometh that they shall be smitten and afflicted.
167                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Wherefore, after they are driven to and fro, for thus saith the angel, many shall be afflicted in the flesh, and shall not be suffered to perish, because of the prayers of the faithful; they shall be scattered, and smitten, and hated; nevertheless, the Lord will be merciful unto them, that when they shall come to the knowledge of their Redeemer, they shall be gathered together again to the lands of their inheritance.
168                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           And blessed are the Gentiles, they of whom the prophet has written; for behold, if it so be that they shall repent and fight not against Zion, and do not unite themselves to that great and abominable church, they shall be saved; for the Lord God will fulfil his covenants which he has made unto his children; and for this cause the prophet has written these things.
169                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             Wherefore, they that fight against Zion and the covenant people of the Lord shall lick up the dust of their feet; and the people of the Lord shall not be ashamed. For the people of the Lord are they who wait for him; for they still wait for the coming of the Messiah.
170                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                And behold, according to the words of the prophet, the Messiah will set himself again the second time to recover them; wherefore, he will manifest himself unto them in power and great glory, unto the destruction of their enemies, when that day cometh when they shall believe in him; and none will he destroy that believe in him.
171                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           And they that believe not in him shall be destroyed, both by fire, and by tempest, and by earthquakes, and by bloodsheds, and by pestilence, and by famine. And they shall know that the Lord is God, the Holy One of Israel.
172                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           For shall the prey be taken from the mighty, or the lawful captive delivered?
173                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      But thus saith the Lord: Even the captives of the mighty shall be taken away, and the prey of the terrible shall be delivered; for the Mighty God shall deliver his covenant people. For thus saith the Lord: I will contend with them that contendeth with thee--
174                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      And I will feed them that oppress thee, with their own flesh; and they shall be drunken with their own blood as with sweet wine; and all flesh shall know that I the Lord am thy Savior and thy Redeemer, the Mighty One of Jacob.
175                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        Yea, for thus saith the Lord: Have I put thee away, or have I cast thee off forever? For thus saith the Lord: Where is the bill of your mother's divorcement? To whom have I put thee away, or to which of my creditors have I sold you? Yea, to whom have I sold you? Behold, for your iniquities have ye sold yourselves, and for your transgressions is your mother put away.
176                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           Wherefore, when I came, there was no man; when I called, yea, there was none to answer. O house of Israel, is my hand shortened at all that it cannot redeem, or have I no power to deliver? Behold, at my rebuke I dry up the sea, I make their rivers a wilderness and their fish to stink because the waters are dried up, and they die because of thirst.

When ye are weary he waketh morning by morning. He waketh mine ear to hear as the learned.

I hid not my face from shame and spitting.

Therefore have I set my face like a flint, and I know that I shall not be ashamed.

Who will contend with me? Let us stand together. Who is mine adversary? Let him come near me, and I will smite him with the strength of my mouth.

And all they who shall condemn me, behold, all they shall wax old as a garment, and the moth shall eat them up.

This shall ye have of mine hand--ye shall lie down in sorrow.

Joy and gladness shall be found therein, thanksgiving and the voice of melody.

The isles shall wait upon me, and on mine arm shall they trust.

But my salvation shall be forever, and my righteousness shall not be abolished.

But my righteousness shall be forever, and my salvation from generation to generation.

Put on strength, O arm of the Lord; awake as in the ancient days. Art thou not he that hath cut Rahab, and wounded the dragon?

And where is the fury of the oppressor?

205                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  Thy sons have fainted, save these two; they lie at the head of all the streets; as a wild bull in a net, they are full of the fury of the Lord, the rebuke of thy God.
206                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                Therefore hear now this, thou afflicted, and drunken, and not with wine:
207                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            Thus saith thy Lord, the Lord and thy God pleadeth the cause of his people; behold, I have taken out of thine hand the cup of trembling, the dregs of the cup of my fury; thou shalt no more drink it again.
208                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                But I will put it into the hand of them that afflict thee; who have said to thy soul: Bow down, that we may go over--and thou hast laid thy body as the ground and as the street to them that went over.
209                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              Awake, awake, put on thy strength, O Zion; put on thy beautiful garments, O Jerusalem, the holy city; for henceforth there shall no more come into thee the uncircumcised and the unclean.
210                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        Shake thyself from the dust; arise, sit down, O Jerusalem; loose thyself from the bands of thy neck, O captive daughter of Zion.
211                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    And now, my beloved brethren, I have read these things that ye might know concerning the covenants of the Lord that he has covenanted with all the house of Israel--
212                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      That he has spoken unto the Jews, by the mouth of his holy prophets, even from the beginning down, from generation to generation, until the time comes that they shall be restored to the true church and fold of God; when they shall be gathered home to the lands of their inheritance, and shall be established in all their lands of promise.
213                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            Behold, my beloved brethren, I speak unto you these things that ye may rejoice, and lift up your heads forever, because of the blessings which the Lord God shall bestow upon your children.
214                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      For I know that ye have searched much, many of you, to know of things to come; wherefore I know that ye know that our flesh must waste away and die; nevertheless, in our bodies we shall see God.
215                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  Yea, I know that ye know that in the body he shall show himself unto those at Jerusalem, from whence we came; for it is expedient that it should be among them; for it behooveth the great Creator that he suffereth himself to become subject unto man in the flesh, and die for all men, that all men might become subject unto him.
216                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 For as death hath passed upon all men, to fulfil the merciful plan of the great Creator, there must needs be a power of resurrection, and the resurrection must needs come unto man by reason of the fall; and the fall came by reason of transgression; and because man became fallen they were cut off from the presence of the Lord.
217                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      Wherefore, it must needs be an infinite atonement--save it should be an infinite atonement this corruption could not put on incorruption. Wherefore, the first judgment which came upon man must needs have remained to an endless duration. And if so, this flesh must have laid down to rot and to crumble to its mother earth, to rise no more.
218                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       O the wisdom of God, his mercy and grace! For behold, if the flesh should rise no more our spirits must become subject to that angel who fell from before the presence of the Eternal God, and became the devil, to rise no more.
219                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  And our spirits must have become like unto him, and we become devils, angels to a devil, to be shut out from the presence of our God, and to remain with the father of lies, in misery, like unto himself; yea, to that being who beguiled our first parents, who transformeth himself nigh unto an angel of light, and stirreth up the children of men unto secret combinations of murder and all manner of secret works of darkness.
220                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  O how great the goodness of our God, who prepareth a way for our escape from the grasp of this awful monster; yea, that monster, death and hell, which I call the death of the body, and also the death of the spirit.
221                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               And because of the way of deliverance of our God, the Holy One of Israel, this death, of which I have spoken, which is the temporal, shall deliver up its dead; which death is the grave.
222                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     And this death of which I have spoken, which is the spiritual death, shall deliver up its dead; which spiritual death is hell; wherefore, death and hell must deliver up their dead, and hell must deliver up its captive spirits, and the grave must deliver up its captive bodies, and the bodies and the spirits of men will be restored one to the other; and it is by the power of the resurrection of the Holy One of Israel.
223                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 O how great the plan of our God! For on the other hand, the paradise of God must deliver up the spirits of the righteous, and the grave deliver up the body of the righteous; and the spirit and the body is restored to itself again, and all men become incorruptible, and immortal, and they are living souls, having a perfect knowledge like unto us in the flesh, save it be that our knowledge shall be perfect.
224                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               Wherefore, we shall have a perfect knowledge of all our guilt, and our uncleanness, and our nakedness; and the righteous shall have a perfect knowledge of their enjoyment, and their righteousness, being clothed with purity, yea, even with the robe of righteousness.
225                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            And it shall come to pass that when all men shall have passed from this first death unto life, insomuch as they have become immortal, they must appear before the judgment-seat of the Holy One of Israel; and then cometh the judgment, and then must they be judged according to the holy judgment of God.
226                                                                                                                                                                                                              And assuredly, as the Lord liveth, for the Lord God hath spoken it, and it is his eternal word, which cannot pass away, that they who are righteous shall be righteous still, and they who are filthy shall be filthy still; wherefore, they who are filthy are the devil and his angels; and they shall go away into everlasting fire, prepared for them; and their torment is as a lake of fire and brimstone, whose flame ascendeth up forever and ever and has no end.
227                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   O the greatness and the justice of our God! For he executeth all his words, and they have gone forth out of his mouth, and his law must be fulfilled.
228                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             But, behold, the righteous, the saints of the Holy One of Israel, they who have believed in the Holy One of Israel, they who have endured the crosses of the world, and despised the shame of it, they shall inherit the kingdom of God, which was prepared for them from the foundation of the world, and their joy shall be full forever.
229                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    O the greatness of the mercy of our God, the Holy One of Israel! For he delivereth his saints from that awful monster the devil, and death, and hell, and that lake of fire and brimstone, which is endless torment.
230                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             O how great the holiness of our God! For he knoweth all things, and there is not anything save he knows it.
231                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     And he cometh into the world that he may save all men if they will hearken unto his voice; for behold, he suffereth the pains of all men, yea, the pains of every living creature, both men, women, and children, who belong to the family of Adam.
232                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     And he suffereth this that the resurrection might pass upon all men, that all might stand before him at the great and judgment day.

234                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  And if they will not repent and believe in his name, and be baptized in his name, and endure to the end, they must be damned; for the Lord God, the Holy One of Israel, has spoken it.
235                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  Wherefore, he has given a law; and where there is no law given there is no punishment; and where there is no punishment there is no condemnation; and where there is no condemnation the mercies of the Holy One of Israel have claim upon them, because of the atonement; for they are delivered by the power of him.
236                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       For the atonement satisfieth the demands of his justice upon all those who have not the law given to them, that they are delivered from that awful monster, death and hell, and the devil, and the lake of fire and brimstone, which is endless torment; and they are restored to that God who gave them breath, which is the Holy One of Israel.
237                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       But wo unto him that has the law given, yea, that has all the commandments of God, like unto us, and that transgresseth them, and that wasteth the days of his probation, for awful is his state!
238                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    O that cunning plan of the evil one! O the vainness, and the frailties, and the foolishness of men! When they are learned they think they are wise, and they hearken not unto the counsel of God, for they set it aside, supposing they know of themselves, wherefore, their wisdom is foolishness and it profiteth them not. And they shall perish.
239                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     But to be learned is good if they hearken unto the counsels of God.
240                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              But wo unto the rich, who are rich as to the things of the world. For because they are rich they despise the poor, and they persecute the meek, and their hearts are upon their treasures; wherefore, their treasure is their god. And behold, their treasure shall perish with them also.

247                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  Yea, wo unto those that worship idols, for the devil of all devils delighteth in them.
248                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     And, in fine, wo unto all those who die in their sins; for they shall return to God, and behold his face, and remain in their sins.
249                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 O, my beloved brethren, remember the awfulness in transgressing against that Holy God, and also the awfulness of yielding to the enticings of that cunning one. Remember, to be carnally-minded is death, and to be spiritually-minded is life eternal.
250                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         O, my beloved brethren, give ear to my words. Remember the greatness of the Holy One of Israel. Do not say that I have spoken hard things against you; for if ye do, ye will revile against the truth; for I have spoken the words of your Maker. I know that the words of truth are hard against all uncleanness; but the righteous fear them not, for they love the truth and are not shaken.
251                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            O then, my beloved brethren, come unto the Lord, the Holy One. Remember that his paths are righteous. Behold, the way for man is narrow, but it lieth in a straight course before him, and the keeper of the gate is the Holy One of Israel; and he employeth no servant there; and there is none other way save it be by the gate; for he cannot be deceived, for the Lord God is his name.
252                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       And whoso knocketh, to him will he open; and the wise, and the learned, and they that are rich, who are puffed up because of their learning, and their wisdom, and their riches--yea, they are they whom he despiseth; and save they shall cast these things away, and consider themselves fools before God, and come down in the depths of humility, he will not open unto them.
253                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        But the things of the wise and the prudent shall be hid from them forever--yea, that happiness which is prepared for the saints.
254                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          O, my beloved brethren, remember my words. Behold, I take off my garments, and I shake them before you; I pray the God of my salvation that he view me with his all-searching eye; wherefore, ye shall know at the last day, when all men shall be judged of their works, that the God of Israel did witness that I shook your iniquities from my soul, and that I stand with brightness before him, and am rid of your blood.
255                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           O, my beloved brethren, turn away from your sins; shake off the chains of him that would bind you fast; come unto that God who is the rock of your salvation.
256                                                                                                                                                                                                                        Prepare your souls for that glorious day when justice shall be administered unto the righteous, even the day of judgment, that ye may not shrink with awful fear; that ye may not remember your awful guilt in perfectness, and be constrained to exclaim: Holy, holy are thy judgments, O Lord God Almighty--but I know my guilt; I transgressed thy law, and my transgressions are mine; and the devil hath obtained me, that I am a prey to his awful misery.
257                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                But behold, my brethren, is it expedient that I should awake you to an awful reality of these things? Would I harrow up your souls if your minds were pure? Would I be plain unto you according to the plainness of the truth if ye were freed from sin?
258                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              Behold, if ye were holy I would speak unto you of holiness; but as ye are not holy, and ye look upon me as a teacher, it must needs be expedient that I teach you the consequences of sin.

261                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Wherefore, do not spend money for that which is of no worth, nor your labor for that which cannot satisfy. Hearken diligently unto me, and remember the words which I have spoken; and come unto the Holy One of Israel, and feast upon that which perisheth not, neither can be corrupted, and let your soul delight in fatness.
262                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Behold, my beloved brethren, remember the words of your God; pray unto him continually by day, and give thanks unto his holy name by night. Let your hearts rejoice.
263                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               And behold how great the covenants of the Lord, and how great his condescensions unto the children of men; and because of his greatness, and his grace and mercy, he has promised unto us that our seed shall not utterly be destroyed, according to the flesh, but that he would preserve them; and in future generations they shall become a righteous branch unto the house of Israel.
264                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           And now, my brethren, I would speak unto you more; but on the morrow I will declare unto you the remainder of my words. Amen.
265                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   And now I, Jacob, speak unto you again, my beloved brethren, concerning this righteous branch of which I have spoken.
266                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   For behold, the promises which we have obtained are promises unto us according to the flesh; wherefore, as it has been shown unto me that many of our children shall perish in the flesh because of unbelief, nevertheless, God will be merciful unto many; and our children shall be restored, that they may come to that which will give them the true knowledge of their Redeemer.
267                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  Wherefore, as I said unto you, it must needs be expedient that Christ--for in the last night the angel spake unto me that this should be his name--should come among the Jews, among those who are the more wicked part of the world; and they shall crucify him--for thus it behooveth our God, and there is none other nation on earth that would crucify their God.
268                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         For should the mighty miracles be wrought among other nations they would repent, and know that he be their God.
269                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               But because of priestcrafts and iniquities, they at Jerusalem will stiffen their necks against him, that he be crucified.
270                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               Wherefore, because of their iniquities, destructions, famines, pestilences, and bloodshed shall come upon them; and they who shall not be destroyed shall be scattered among all nations.
271                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      But behold, thus saith the Lord God: When the day cometh that they shall believe in me, that I am Christ, then have I covenanted with their fathers that they shall be restored in the flesh, upon the earth, unto the lands of their inheritance.
272                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            And it shall come to pass that they shall be gathered in from their long dispersion, from the isles of the sea, and from the four parts of the earth; and the nations of the Gentiles shall be great in the eyes of me, saith God, in carrying them forth to the lands of their inheritance.
273                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          Yea, the kings of the Gentiles shall be nursing fathers unto them, and their queens shall become nursing mothers; wherefore, the promises of the Lord are great unto the Gentiles, for he hath spoken it, and who can dispute?
274                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 But behold, this land, said God, shall be a land of thine inheritance, and the Gentiles shall be blessed upon the land.
275                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            And this land shall be a land of liberty unto the Gentiles, and there shall be no kings upon the land, who shall raise up unto the Gentiles.
276                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 And I will fortify this land against all other nations.
277                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              And he that fighteth against Zion shall perish, saith God.
278                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            For he that raiseth up a king against me shall perish, for I, the Lord, the king of heaven, will be their king, and I will be a light unto them forever, that hear my words.
279                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 Wherefore, for this cause, that my covenants may be fulfilled which I have made unto the children of men, that I will do unto them while they are in the flesh, I must needs destroy the secret works of darkness, and of murders, and of abominations.
280                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                Wherefore, he that fighteth against Zion, both Jew and Gentile, both bond and free, both male and female, shall perish; for they are they who are the whore of all the earth; for they who are not for me are against me, saith our God.
281                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        For I will fulfil my promises which I have made unto the children of men, that I will do unto them while they are in the flesh--
282                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        Wherefore, my beloved brethren, thus saith our God: I will afflict thy seed by the hand of the Gentiles; nevertheless, I will soften the hearts of the Gentiles, that they shall be like unto a father to them; wherefore, the Gentiles shall be blessed and numbered among the house of Israel.
283                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             Wherefore, I will consecrate this land unto thy seed, and them who shall be numbered among thy seed, forever, for the land of their inheritance; for it is a choice land, saith God unto me, above all other lands, wherefore I will have all men that dwell thereon that they shall worship me, saith God.
284                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         And now, my beloved brethren, seeing that our merciful God has given us so great knowledge concerning these things, let us remember him, and lay aside our sins, and not hang down our heads, for we are not cast off; nevertheless, we have been driven out of the land of our inheritance; but we have been led to a better land, for the Lord has made the sea our path, and we are upon an isle of the sea.
285                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        But great are the promises of the Lord unto them who are upon the isles of the sea; wherefore as it says isles, there must needs be more than this, and they are inhabited also by our brethren.
286                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         For behold, the Lord God has led away from time to time from the house of Israel, according to his will and pleasure. And now behold, the Lord remembereth all them who have been broken off, wherefore he remembereth us also.

288                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             Wherefore, my beloved brethren, reconcile yourselves to the will of God, and not to the will of the devil and the flesh; and remember, after ye are reconciled unto God, that it is only in and through the grace of God that ye are saved.
289                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Wherefore, may God raise you from death by the power of the resurrection, and also from everlasting death by the power of the atonement, that ye may be received into the eternal kingdom of God, that ye may praise him through grace divine. Amen.
290                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          And now, Jacob spake many more things to my people at that time; nevertheless only these things have I caused to be written, for the things which I have written sufficeth me.
291                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           And now I, Nephi, write more of the words of Isaiah, for my soul delighteth in his words. For I will liken his words unto my people, and I will send them forth unto all my children, for he verily saw my Redeemer, even as I have seen him.
292                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    And my brother, Jacob, also has seen him as I have seen him; wherefore, I will send their words forth unto my children to prove unto them that my words are true. Wherefore, by the words of three, God hath said, I will establish my word. Nevertheless, God sendeth more witnesses, and he proveth all his words.
293                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            Behold, my soul delighteth in proving unto my people the truth of the coming of Christ; for, for this end hath the law of Moses been given; and all things which have been given of God from the beginning of the world, unto man, are the typifying of him.
294                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     And also my soul delighteth in the covenants of the Lord which he hath made to our fathers; yea, my soul delighteth in his grace, and in his justice, and power, and mercy in the great and eternal plan of deliverance from death.
295                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      And my soul delighteth in proving unto my people that save Christ should come all men must perish.
296                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                For if there be no Christ there be no God; and if there be no God we are not, for there could have been no creation. But there is a God, and he is Christ, and he cometh in the fulness of his own time.
297                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  And now I write some of the words of Isaiah, that whoso of my people shall see these words may lift up their hearts and rejoice for all men. Now these are the words, and ye may liken them unto you and unto all men.
298                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              The word that Isaiah, the son of Amoz, saw concerning Judah and Jerusalem:
299                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           And it shall come to pass in the last days, when the mountain of the Lord's house shall be established in the top of the mountains, and shall be exalted above the hills, and all nations shall flow unto it.

Wo unto their souls, for they have rewarded evil unto themselves!

O my people, they who lead thee cause thee to err and destroy the way of thy paths.

Ye beat my people to pieces, and grind the faces of the poor, saith the Lord God of Hosts.

My well-beloved hath a vineyard in a very fruitful hill.

Wherefore, when I looked that it should bring forth grapes it brought forth wild grapes.

357                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   And I will lay it waste; it shall not be pruned nor digged; but there shall come up briers and thorns; I will also command the clouds that they rain no rain upon it.

374                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           Who justify the wicked for reward, and take away the righteousness of the righteous from him!
375                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Therefore, as the fire devoureth the stubble, and the flame consumeth the chaff, their root shall be rottenness, and their blossoms shall go up as dust; because they have cast away the law of the Lord of Hosts, and despised the word of the Holy One of Israel.
376                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         Therefore, is the anger of the Lord kindled against his people, and he hath stretched forth his hand against them, and hath smitten them; and the hills did tremble, and their carcasses were torn in the midst of the streets. For all this his anger is not turned away, but his hand is stretched out still.
377                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   And he will lift up an ensign to the nations from far, and will hiss unto them from the end of the earth; and behold, they shall come with speed swiftly; none shall be weary nor stumble among them.
378                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              None shall slumber nor sleep; neither shall the girdle of their loins be loosed, nor the latchet of their shoes be broken;
379                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                Whose arrows shall be sharp, and all their bows bent, and their horses' hoofs shall be counted like flint, and their wheels like a whirlwind, their roaring like a lion.

385                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    And the posts of the door moved at the voice of him that cried, and the house was filled with smoke.
386                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             Then said I: Wo is unto me! for I am undone; because I am a man of unclean lips; and I dwell in the midst of a people of unclean lips; for mine eyes have seen the King, the Lord of Hosts.
387                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            Then flew one of the seraphim unto me, having a live coal in his hand, which he had taken with the tongs from off the altar;
388                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            And he laid it upon my mouth, and said: Lo, this has touched thy lips; and thine iniquity is taken away, and thy sin purged.
389                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 Also I heard the voice of the Lord, saying: Whom shall I send, and who will go for us? Then I said: Here am I; send me.

391                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            Make the heart of this people fat, and make their ears heavy, and shut their eyes--lest they see with their eyes, and hear with their ears, and understand with their heart, and be converted and be healed.
392                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  Then said I: Lord, how long? And he said: Until the cities be wasted without inhabitant, and the houses without man, and the land be utterly desolate;
393                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  And the Lord have removed men far away, for there shall be a great forsaking in the midst of the land.
394                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       But yet there shall be a tenth, and they shall return, and shall be eaten, as a teil-tree, and as an oak whose substance is in them when they cast their leaves; so the holy seed shall be the substance thereof.
395                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    And it came to pass in the days of Ahaz the son of Jotham, the son of Uzziah, king of Judah, that Rezin, king of Syria, and Pekah the son of Remaliah, king of Israel, went up toward Jerusalem to war against it, but could not prevail against it.
396                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  And it was told the house of David, saying: Syria is confederate with Ephraim. And his heart was moved, and the heart of his people, as the trees of the wood are moved with the wind.

403                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               And the head of Ephraim is Samaria, and the head of Samaria is Remaliah's son. If ye will not believe surely ye shall not be established.

405                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              Ask thee a sign of the Lord thy God; ask it either in the depths, or in the heights above.
406                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           But Ahaz said: I will not ask, neither will I tempt the Lord.
407                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    And he said: Hear ye now, O house of David; is it a small thing for you to weary men, but will ye weary my God also?
408                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             Therefore, the Lord himself shall give you a sign--Behold, a virgin shall conceive, and shall bear a son, and shall call his name Immanuel.

Then said the Lord to me: Call his name, Maher-shalal-hash-baz.

425                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        Forasmuch as this people refuseth the waters of Shiloah that go softly, and rejoice in Rezin and Remaliah's son;
426                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      Now therefore, behold, the Lord bringeth up upon them the waters of the river, strong and many, even the king of Assyria and all his glory; and he shall come up over all his channels, and go over all his banks.

The zeal of the Lord of Hosts will perform this.

For all this his anger is not turned away, but his hand is stretched out still.

458                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 Therefore the Lord shall have no joy in their young men, neither shall have mercy on their fatherless and widows; for every one of them is a hypocrite and an evildoer, and every mouth speaketh folly.

Shall the saw magnify itself against him that shaketh it? As if the rod should shake itself against them that lift it up, or as if the staff should lift up itself as if it were no wood!

For I will destroy her speedily; yea, for I will be merciful unto my people, but the wicked shall perish.

And the house of Israel shall possess them, and the land of the Lord shall be for servants and handmaids; and they shall take them captives unto whom they were captives; and they shall rule over their oppressors.
543                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                And it shall come to pass in that day that the Lord shall give thee rest, from thy sorrow, and from thy fear, and from the hard bondage wherein thou wast made to serve.
544                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                And it shall come to pass in that day, that thou shalt take up this proverb against the king of Babylon, and say: How hath the oppressor ceased, the golden city ceased!

572                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    What shall then answer the messengers of the nations? That the Lord hath founded Zion, and the poor of his people shall trust in it.
573                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              Now I, Nephi, do speak somewhat concerning the words which I have written, which have been spoken by the mouth of Isaiah. For behold, Isaiah spake many things which were hard for many of my people to understand; for they know not concerning the manner of prophesying among the Jews.
574                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 For I, Nephi, have not taught them many things concerning the manner of the Jews; for their works were works of darkness, and their doings were doings of abominations.
575                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        Wherefore, I write unto my people, unto all those that shall receive hereafter these things which I write, that they may know the judgments of God, that they come upon all nations, according to the word which he hath spoken.
576                                                                                                                                      Wherefore, hearken, O my people, which are of the house of Israel, and give ear unto my words; for because the words of Isaiah are not plain unto you, nevertheless they are plain unto all those that are filled with the spirit of prophecy. But I give unto you a prophecy, according to the spirit which is in me; wherefore I shall prophesy according to the plainness which hath been with me from the time that I came out from Jerusalem with my father; for behold, my soul delighteth in plainness unto my people, that they may learn.
577                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           Yea, and my soul delighteth in the words of Isaiah, for I came out from Jerusalem, and mine eyes hath beheld the things of the Jews, and I know that the Jews do understand the things of the prophets, and there is none other people that understand the things which were spoken unto the Jews like unto them, save it be that they are taught after the manner of the things of the Jews.
578                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    But behold, I, Nephi, have not taught my children after the manner of the Jews; but behold, I, of myself, have dwelt at Jerusalem, wherefore I know concerning the regions round about; and I have made mention unto my children concerning the judgments of God, which hath come to pass among the Jews, unto my children, according to all that which Isaiah hath spoken, and I do not write them.
579                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     But behold, I proceed with mine own prophecy, according to my plainness; in the which I know that no man can err; nevertheless, in the days that the prophecies of Isaiah shall be fulfilled men shall know of a surety, at the times when they shall come to pass.
580                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Wherefore, they are of worth unto the children of men, and he that supposeth that they are not, unto them will I speak particularly, and confine the words unto mine own people; for I know that they shall be of great worth unto them in the last days; for in that day shall they understand them; wherefore, for their good have I written them.
581                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           And as one generation hath been destroyed among the Jews because of iniquity, even so have they been destroyed from generation to generation according to their iniquities; and never hath any of them been destroyed save it were foretold them by the prophets of the Lord.
582                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Wherefore, it hath been told them concerning the destruction which should come upon them, immediately after my father left Jerusalem; nevertheless, they hardened their hearts; and according to my prophecy they have been destroyed, save it be those which are carried away captive into Babylon.
583                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        And now this I speak because of the spirit which is in me. And notwithstanding they have been carried away they shall return again, and possess the land of Jerusalem; wherefore, they shall be restored again to the land of their inheritance.
584                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         But, behold, they shall have wars, and rumors of wars; and when the day cometh that the Only Begotten of the Father, yea, even the Father of heaven and of earth, shall manifest himself unto them in the flesh, behold, they will reject him, because of their iniquities, and the hardness of their hearts, and the stiffness of their necks.
585                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Behold, they will crucify him; and after he is laid in a sepulchre for the space of three days he shall rise from the dead, with healing in his wings; and all those who shall believe on his name shall be saved in the kingdom of God. Wherefore, my soul delighteth to prophesy concerning him, for I have seen his day, and my heart doth magnify his holy name.
586                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              And behold it shall come to pass that after the Messiah hath risen from the dead, and hath manifested himself unto his people, unto as many as will believe on his name, behold, Jerusalem shall be destroyed again; for wo unto them that fight against God and the people of his church.
587                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            Wherefore, the Jews shall be scattered among all nations; yea, and also Babylon shall be destroyed; wherefore, the Jews shall be scattered by other nations.
588                                                                                And after they have been scattered, and the Lord God hath scourged them by other nations for the space of many generations, yea, even down from generation to generation until they shall be persuaded to believe in Christ, the Son of God, and the atonement, which is infinite for all mankind--and when that day shall come that they shall believe in Christ, and worship the Father in his name, with pure hearts and clean hands, and look not forward any more for another Messiah, then, at that time, the day will come that it must needs be expedient that they should believe these things.
589                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  And the Lord will set his hand again the second time to restore his people from their lost and fallen state. Wherefore, he will proceed to do a marvelous work and a wonder among the children of men.
590                                                                                                                                                 Wherefore, he shall bring forth his words unto them, which words shall judge them at the last day, for they shall be given them for the purpose of convincing them of the true Messiah, who was rejected by them; and unto the convincing of them that they need not look forward any more for a Messiah to come, for there should not any come, save it should be a false Messiah which should deceive the people; for there is save one Messiah spoken of by the prophets, and that Messiah is he who should be rejected of the Jews.
591                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     For according to the words of the prophets, the Messiah cometh in six hundred years from the time that my father left Jerusalem; and according to the words of the prophets, and also the word of the angel of God, his name shall be Jesus Christ, the Son of God.
592                                 And now, my brethren, I have spoken plainly that ye cannot err. And as the Lord God liveth that brought Israel up out of the land of Egypt, and gave unto Moses power that he should heal the nations after they had been bitten by the poisonous serpents, if they would cast their eyes unto the serpent which he did raise up before them, and also gave him power that he should smite the rock and the water should come forth; yea, behold I say unto you, that as these things are true, and as the Lord God liveth, there is none other name given under heaven save it be this Jesus Christ, of which I have spoken, whereby man can be saved.
593                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              Wherefore, for this cause hath the Lord God promised unto me that these things which I write shall be kept and preserved, and handed down unto my seed, from generation to generation, that the promise may be fulfilled unto Joseph, that his seed should never perish as long as the earth should stand.
594                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  Wherefore, these things shall go from generation to generation as long as the earth shall stand; and they shall go according to the will and pleasure of God; and the nations who shall possess them shall be judged of them according to the words which are written.
595                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           For we labor diligently to write, to persuade our children, and also our brethren, to believe in Christ, and to be reconciled to God; for we know that it is by grace that we are saved, after all we can do.
596                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 And, notwithstanding we believe in Christ, we keep the law of Moses, and look forward with steadfastness unto Christ, until the law shall be fulfilled.
597                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 For, for this end was the law given; wherefore the law hath become dead unto us, and we are made alive in Christ because of our faith; yet we keep the law because of the commandments.
598                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               And we talk of Christ, we rejoice in Christ, we preach of Christ, we prophesy of Christ, and we write according to our prophecies, that our children may know to what source they may look for a remission of their sins.
599                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  Wherefore, we speak concerning the law that our children may know the deadness of the law; and they, by knowing the deadness of the law, may look forward unto that life which is in Christ, and know for what end the law was given. And after the law is fulfilled in Christ, that they need not harden their hearts against him when the law ought to be done away.
600                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                And now behold, my people, ye are a stiffnecked people; wherefore, I have spoken plainly unto you, that ye cannot misunderstand. And the words which I have spoken shall stand as a testimony against you; for they are sufficient to teach any man the right way; for the right way is to believe in Christ and deny him not; for by denying him ye also deny the prophets and the law.
601                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               And now behold, I say unto you that the right way is to believe in Christ, and deny him not; and Christ is the Holy One of Israel; wherefore ye must bow down before him, and worship him with all your might, mind, and strength, and your whole soul; and if ye do this ye shall in nowise be cast out.

604                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     For behold, I say unto you that I have beheld that many generations shall pass away, and there shall be great wars and contentions among my people.
605                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  And after the Messiah shall come there shall be signs given unto my people of his birth, and also of his death and resurrection; and great and terrible shall that day be unto the wicked, for they shall perish; and they perish because they cast out the prophets, and the saints, and stone them, and slay them; wherefore the cry of the blood of the saints shall ascend up to God from the ground against them.
606                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                Wherefore, all those who are proud, and that do wickedly, the day that cometh shall burn them up, saith the Lord of Hosts, for they shall be as stubble.
607                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    And they that kill the prophets, and the saints, the depths of the earth shall swallow them up, saith the Lord of Hosts; and mountains shall cover them, and whirlwinds shall carry them away, and buildings shall fall upon them and crush them to pieces and grind them to powder.
608                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    And they shall be visited with thunderings, and lightnings, and earthquakes, and all manner of destructions, for the fire of the anger of the Lord shall be kindled against them, and they shall be as stubble, and the day that cometh shall consume them, saith the Lord of Hosts.
609                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                O the pain, and the anguish of my soul for the loss of the slain of my people! For I, Nephi, have seen it, and it well nigh consumeth me before the presence of the Lord; but I must cry unto my God: Thy ways are just.
610                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              But behold, the righteous that hearken unto the words of the prophets, and destroy them not, but look forward unto Christ with steadfastness for the signs which are given, notwithstanding all persecution--behold, they are they which shall not perish.
611                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             But the Son of righteousness shall appear unto them; and he shall heal them, and they shall have peace with him, until three generations shall have passed away, and many of the fourth generation shall have passed away in righteousness.
612                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       And when these things have passed away a speedy destruction cometh unto my people; for, notwithstanding the pains of my soul, I have seen it; wherefore, I know that it shall come to pass; and they sell themselves for naught; for, for the reward of their pride and their foolishness they shall reap destruction; for because they yield unto the devil and choose works of darkness rather than light, therefore they must go down to hell.
613                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   For the Spirit of the Lord will not always strive with man. And when the Spirit ceaseth to strive with man then cometh speedy destruction, and this grieveth my soul.
614                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    And as I spake concerning the convincing of the Jews, that Jesus is the very Christ, it must needs be that the Gentiles be convinced also that Jesus is the Christ, the Eternal God;
615                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                And that he manifesteth himself unto all those who believe in him, by the power of the Holy Ghost; yea, unto every nation, kindred, tongue, and people, working mighty miracles, signs, and wonders, among the children of men according to their faith.
616                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                But behold, I prophesy unto you concerning the last days; concerning the days when the Lord God shall bring these things forth unto the children of men.

618                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                For those who shall be destroyed shall speak unto them out of the ground, and their speech shall be low out of the dust, and their voice shall be as one that hath a familiar spirit; for the Lord God will give unto him power, that he may whisper concerning them, even as it were out of the ground; and their speech shall whisper out of the dust.
619                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    For thus saith the Lord God: They shall write the things which shall be done among them, and they shall be written and sealed up in a book, and those who have dwindled in unbelief shall not have them, for they seek to destroy the things of God.
620                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             Wherefore, as those who have been destroyed have been destroyed speedily; and the multitude of their terrible ones shall be as chaff that passeth away--yea, thus saith the Lord God: It shall be at an instant, suddenly--
621                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       And it shall come to pass, that those who have dwindled in unbelief shall be smitten by the hand of the Gentiles.
622                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   And the Gentiles are lifted up in the pride of their eyes, and have stumbled, because of the greatness of their stumbling block, that they have built up many churches; nevertheless, they put down the power and miracles of God, and preach up unto themselves their own wisdom and their own learning, that they may get gain and grind upon the face of the poor.
623                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     And there are many churches built up which cause envyings, and strifes, and malice.
624                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                And there are also secret combinations, even as in times of old, according to the combinations of the devil, for he is the founder of all these things; yea, the founder of murder, and works of darkness; yea, and he leadeth them by the neck with a flaxen cord, until he bindeth them with his strong cords forever.
625                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              For behold, my beloved brethren, I say unto you that the Lord God worketh not in darkness.
626                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            He doeth not anything save it be for the benefit of the world; for he loveth the world, even that he layeth down his own life that he may draw all men unto him. Wherefore, he commandeth none that they shall not partake of his salvation.
627                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            Behold, doth he cry unto any, saying: Depart from me? Behold, I say unto you, Nay; but he saith: Come unto me all ye ends of the earth, buy milk and honey, without money and without price.
628                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              Behold, hath he commanded any that they should depart out of the synagogues, or out of the houses of worship? Behold, I say unto you, Nay.
629                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               Hath he commanded any that they should not partake of his salvation? Behold I say unto you, Nay; but he hath given it free for all men; and he hath commanded his people that they should persuade all men to repentance.
630                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           Behold, hath the Lord commanded any that they should not partake of his goodness? Behold I say unto you, Nay; but all men are privileged the one like unto the other, and none are forbidden.
631                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               He commandeth that there shall be no priestcrafts; for, behold, priestcrafts are that men preach and set themselves up for a light unto the world, that they may get gain and praise of the world; but they seek not the welfare of Zion.
632                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                Behold, the Lord hath forbidden this thing; wherefore, the Lord God hath given a commandment that all men should have charity, which charity is love. And except they should have charity they were nothing. Wherefore, if they should have charity they would not suffer the laborer in Zion to perish.
633                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            But the laborer in Zion shall labor for Zion; for if they labor for money they shall perish.
634                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          And again, the Lord God hath commanded that men should not murder; that they should not lie; that they should not steal; that they should not take the name of the Lord their God in vain; that they should not envy; that they should not have malice; that they should not contend one with another; that they should not commit whoredoms; and that they should do none of these things; for whoso doeth them shall perish.
635                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             For none of these iniquities come of the Lord; for he doeth that which is good among the children of men; and he doeth nothing save it be plain unto the children of men; and he inviteth them all to come unto him and partake of his goodness; and he denieth none that come unto him, black and white, bond and free, male and female; and he remembereth the heathen; and all are alike unto God, both Jew and Gentile.
636                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  But, behold, in the last days, or in the days of the Gentiles--yea, behold all the nations of the Gentiles and also the Jews, both those who shall come upon this land and those who shall be upon other lands, yea, even upon all the lands of the earth, behold, they will be drunken with iniquity and all manner of abominations--
637                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              And when that day shall come they shall be visited of the Lord of Hosts, with thunder and with earthquake, and with a great noise, and with storm, and with tempest, and with the flame of devouring fire.
638                                                                                                                                                                                                                  And all the nations that fight against Zion, and that distress her, shall be as a dream of a night vision; yea, it shall be unto them, even as unto a hungry man which dreameth, and behold he eateth but he awaketh and his soul is empty; or like unto a thirsty man which dreameth, and behold he drinketh but he awaketh and behold he is faint, and his soul hath appetite; yea, even so shall the multitude of all the nations be that fight against Mount Zion.
639                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              For behold, all ye that doeth iniquity, stay yourselves and wonder, for ye shall cry out, and cry; yea, ye shall be drunken but not with wine, ye shall stagger but not with strong drink.
640                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               For behold, the Lord hath poured out upon you the spirit of deep sleep. For behold, ye have closed your eyes, and ye have rejected the prophets; and your rulers, and the seers hath he covered because of your iniquity.
641                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   And it shall come to pass that the Lord God shall bring forth unto you the words of a book, and they shall be the words of them which have slumbered.
642                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             And behold the book shall be sealed; and in the book shall be a revelation from God, from the beginning of the world to the ending thereof.
643                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Wherefore, because of the things which are sealed up, the things which are sealed shall not be delivered in the day of the wickedness and abominations of the people. Wherefore the book shall be kept from them.
644                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     But the book shall be delivered unto a man, and he shall deliver the words of the book, which are the words of those who have slumbered in the dust, and he shall deliver these words unto another;
645                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         But the words which are sealed he shall not deliver, neither shall he deliver the book. For the book shall be sealed by the power of God, and the revelation which was sealed shall be kept in the book until the own due time of the Lord, that they may come forth; for behold, they reveal all things from the foundation of the world unto the end thereof.
646                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      And the day cometh that the words of the book which were sealed shall be read upon the house tops; and they shall be read by the power of Christ; and all things shall be revealed unto the children of men which ever have been among the children of men, and which ever will be even unto the end of the earth.
647                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      Wherefore, at that day when the book shall be delivered unto the man of whom I have spoken, the book shall be hid from the eyes of the world, that the eyes of none shall behold it save it be that three witnesses shall behold it, by the power of God, besides him to whom the book shall be delivered; and they shall testify to the truth of the book and the things therein.
648                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 And there is none other which shall view it, save it be a few according to the will of God, to bear testimony of his word unto the children of men; for the Lord God hath said that the words of the faithful should speak as if it were from the dead.
649                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Wherefore, the Lord God will proceed to bring forth the words of the book; and in the mouth of as many witnesses as seemeth him good will he establish his word; and wo be unto him that rejecteth the word of God!
650                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            But behold, it shall come to pass that the Lord God shall say unto him to whom he shall deliver the book: Take these words which are not sealed and deliver them to another, that he may show them unto the learned, saying: Read this, I pray thee. And the learned shall say: Bring hither the book, and I will read them.
651                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            And now, because of the glory of the world and to get gain will they say this, and not for the glory of God.
652                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       And the man shall say: I cannot bring the book, for it is sealed.
653                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           Then shall the learned say: I cannot read it.
654                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           Wherefore it shall come to pass, that the Lord God will deliver again the book and the words thereof to him that is not learned; and the man that is not learned shall say: I am not learned.
655                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                Then shall the Lord God say unto him: The learned shall not read them, for they have rejected them, and I am able to do mine own work; wherefore thou shalt read the words which I shall give unto thee.
656                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Touch not the things which are sealed, for I will bring them forth in mine own due time; for I will show unto the children of men that I am able to do mine own work.
657                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Wherefore, when thou hast read the words which I have commanded thee, and obtained the witnesses which I have promised unto thee, then shalt thou seal up the book again, and hide it up unto me, that I may preserve the words which thou hast not read, until I shall see fit in mine own wisdom to reveal all things unto the children of men.
658                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        For behold, I am God; and I am a God of miracles; and I will show unto the world that I am the same yesterday, today, and forever; and I work not among the children of men save it be according to their faith.
659                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 And again it shall come to pass that the Lord shall say unto him that shall read the words that shall be delivered him:
660                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Forasmuch as this people draw near unto me with their mouth, and with their lips do honor me, but have removed their hearts far from me, and their fear towards me is taught by the precepts of men--
661                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Therefore, I will proceed to do a marvelous work among this people, yea, a marvelous work and a wonder, for the wisdom of their wise and learned shall perish, and the understanding of their prudent shall be hid.
662                                                                                                                                                                                          And wo unto them that seek deep to hide their counsel from the Lord! And their works are in the dark; and they say: Who seeth us, and who knoweth us? And they also say: Surely, your turning of things upside down shall be esteemed as the potter's clay. But behold, I will show unto them, saith the Lord of Hosts, that I know all their works. For shall the work say of him that made it, he made me not? Or shall the thing framed say of him that framed it, he had no understanding?

For the day shall come that the Lord God will speedily visit the inhabitants of the earth; and in that day that they are fully ripe in iniquity they shall perish.

691                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  And others will he pacify, and lull them away into carnal security, that they will say: All is well in Zion; yea, Zion prospereth, all is well--and thus the devil cheateth their souls, and leadeth them away carefully down to hell.
692                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              And behold, others he flattereth away, and telleth them there is no hell; and he saith unto them: I am no devil, for there is none--and thus he whispereth in their ears, until he grasps them with his awful chains, from whence there is no deliverance.
693                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            Yea, they are grasped with death, and hell; and death, and hell, and the devil, and all that have been seized therewith must stand before the throne of God, and be judged according to their works, from whence they must go into the place prepared for them, even a lake of fire and brimstone, which is endless torment.

For behold, he that is built upon the rock receiveth it with gladness; and he that is built upon a sandy foundation trembleth lest he shall fall.

700                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                For behold, thus saith the Lord God: I will give unto the children of men line upon line, precept upon precept, here a little and there a little; and blessed are those who hearken unto my precepts, and lend an ear unto my counsel, for they shall learn wisdom; for unto him that receiveth I will give more; and from them that shall say, We have enough, from them shall be taken away even that which they have.

For notwithstanding I shall lengthen out mine arm unto them from day to day, they will deny me; nevertheless, I will be merciful unto them, saith the Lord God, if they will repent and come unto me; for mine arm is lengthened out all the day long, saith the Lord God of Hosts.
703                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  But behold, there shall be many--at that day when I shall proceed to do a marvelous work among them, that I may remember my covenants which I have made unto the children of men, that I may set my hand again the second time to recover my people, which are of the house of Israel;
704                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               And also, that I may remember the promises which I have made unto thee, Nephi, and also unto thy father, that I would remember your seed; and that the words of your seed should proceed forth out of my mouth unto your seed; and my words shall hiss forth unto the ends of the earth, for a standard unto my people, which are of the house of Israel;
705                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       And because my words shall hiss forth--many of the Gentiles shall say: A Bible! A Bible! We have got a Bible, and there cannot be any more Bible.
706                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   But thus saith the Lord God: O fools, they shall have a Bible; and it shall proceed forth from the Jews, mine ancient covenant people. And what thank they the Jews for the Bible which they receive from them? Yea, what do the Gentiles mean? Do they remember the travails, and the labors, and the pains of the Jews, and their diligence unto me, in bringing forth salvation unto the Gentiles?
707                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          O ye Gentiles, have ye remembered the Jews, mine ancient covenant people? Nay; but ye have cursed them, and have hated them, and have not sought to recover them. But behold, I will return all these things upon your own heads; for I the Lord have not forgotten my people.
708                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  Thou fool, that shall say: A Bible, we have got a Bible, and we need no more Bible. Have ye obtained a Bible save it were by the Jews?
709                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             Know ye not that there are more nations than one? Know ye not that I, the Lord your God, have created all men, and that I remember those who are upon the isles of the sea; and that I rule in the heavens above and in the earth beneath; and I bring forth my word unto the children of men, yea, even upon all the nations of the earth?
710                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         Wherefore murmur ye, because that ye shall receive more of my word? Know ye not that the testimony of two nations is a witness unto you that I am God, that I remember one nation like unto another? Wherefore, I speak the same words unto one nation like unto another. And when the two nations shall run together the testimony of the two nations shall run together also.
711                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           And I do this that I may prove unto many that I am the same yesterday, today, and forever; and that I speak forth my words according to mine own pleasure. And because that I have spoken one word ye need not suppose that I cannot speak another; for my work is not yet finished; neither shall it be until the end of man, neither from that time henceforth and forever.
712                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           Wherefore, because that ye have a Bible ye need not suppose that it contains all my words; neither need ye suppose that I have not caused more to be written.
713                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        For I command all men, both in the east and in the west, and in the north, and in the south, and in the islands of the sea, that they shall write the words which I speak unto them; for out of the books which shall be written I will judge the world, every man according to their works, according to that which is written.
714                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   For behold, I shall speak unto the Jews and they shall write it; and I shall also speak unto the Nephites and they shall write it; and I shall also speak unto the other tribes of the house of Israel, which I have led away, and they shall write it; and I shall also speak unto all nations of the earth and they shall write it.
715                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      And it shall come to pass that the Jews shall have the words of the Nephites, and the Nephites shall have the words of the Jews; and the Nephites and the Jews shall have the words of the lost tribes of Israel; and the lost tribes of Israel shall have the words of the Nephites and the Jews.
716                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                And it shall come to pass that my people, which are of the house of Israel, shall be gathered home unto the lands of their possessions; and my word also shall be gathered in one. And I will show unto them that fight against my word and against my people, who are of the house of Israel, that I am God, and that I covenanted with Abraham that I would remember his seed forever.
717                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           And now behold, my beloved brethren, I would speak unto you; for I, Nephi, would not suffer that ye should suppose that ye are more righteous than the Gentiles shall be. For behold, except ye shall keep the commandments of God ye shall all likewise perish; and because of the words which have been spoken ye need not suppose that the Gentiles are utterly destroyed.
718                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    For behold, I say unto you that as many of the Gentiles as will repent are the covenant people of the Lord; and as many of the Jews as will not repent shall be cast off; for the Lord covenanteth with none save it be with them that repent and believe in his Son, who is the Holy One of Israel.
719                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       And now, I would prophesy somewhat more concerning the Jews and the Gentiles. For after the book of which I have spoken shall come forth, and be written unto the Gentiles, and sealed up again unto the Lord, there shall be many which shall believe the words which are written; and they shall carry them forth unto the remnant of our seed.

721                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       And the gospel of Jesus Christ shall be declared among them; wherefore, they shall be restored unto the knowledge of their fathers, and also to the knowledge of Jesus Christ, which was had among their fathers.
722                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       And then shall they rejoice; for they shall know that it is a blessing unto them from the hand of God; and their scales of darkness shall begin to fall from their eyes; and many generations shall not pass away among them, save they shall be a pure and a delightsome people.
723                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          And it shall come to pass that the Jews which are scattered also shall begin to believe in Christ; and they shall begin to gather in upon the face of the land; and as many as shall believe in Christ shall also become a delightsome people.
724                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      And it shall come to pass that the Lord God shall commence his work among all nations, kindreds, tongues, and people, to bring about the restoration of his people upon the earth.
725                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          And with righteousness shall the Lord God judge the poor, and reprove with equity for the meek of the earth. And he shall smite the earth with the rod of his mouth; and with the breath of his lips shall he slay the wicked.
726                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              For the time speedily cometh that the Lord God shall cause a great division among the people, and the wicked will he destroy; and he will spare his people, yea, even if it so be that he must destroy the wicked by fire.
727                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           And righteousness shall be the girdle of his loins, and faithfulness the girdle of his reins.
728                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              And then shall the wolf dwell with the lamb; and the leopard shall lie down with the kid, and the calf, and the young lion, and the fatling, together; and a little child shall lead them.
729                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                And the cow and the bear shall feed; their young ones shall lie down together; and the lion shall eat straw like the ox.
730                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               And the sucking child shall play on the hole of the asp, and the weaned child shall put his hand on the cockatrice's den.
731                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          They shall not hurt nor destroy in all my holy mountain; for the earth shall be full of the knowledge of the Lord as the waters cover the sea.
732                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 Wherefore, the things of all nations shall be made known; yea, all things shall be made known unto the children of men.
733                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      There is nothing which is secret save it shall be revealed; there is no work of darkness save it shall be made manifest in the light; and there is nothing which is sealed upon the earth save it shall be loosed.
734                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           Wherefore, all things which have been revealed unto the children of men shall at that day be revealed; and Satan shall have power over the hearts of the children of men no more, for a long time. And now, my beloved brethren, I make an end of my sayings.
735                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              And now I, Nephi, make an end of my prophesying unto you, my beloved brethren. And I cannot write but a few things, which I know must surely come to pass; neither can I write but a few of the words of my brother Jacob.
736                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          Wherefore, the things which I have written sufficeth me, save it be a few words which I must speak concerning the doctrine of Christ; wherefore, I shall speak unto you plainly, according to the plainness of my prophesying.
737                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      For my soul delighteth in plainness; for after this manner doth the Lord God work among the children of men. For the Lord God giveth light unto the understanding; for he speaketh unto men according to their language, unto their understanding.
738                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        Wherefore, I would that ye should remember that I have spoken unto you concerning that prophet which the Lord showed unto me, that should baptize the Lamb of God, which should take away the sins of the world.
739                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                And now, if the Lamb of God, he being holy, should have need to be baptized by water, to fulfil all righteousness, O then, how much more need have we, being unholy, to be baptized, yea, even by water!
740                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      And now, I would ask of you, my beloved brethren, wherein the Lamb of God did fulfil all righteousness in being baptized by water?
741                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 Know ye not that he was holy? But notwithstanding he being holy, he showeth unto the children of men that, according to the flesh he humbleth himself before the Father, and witnesseth unto the Father that he would be obedient unto him in keeping his commandments.
742                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Wherefore, after he was baptized with water the Holy Ghost descended upon him in the form of a dove.
743                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           And again, it showeth unto the children of men the straitness of the path, and the narrowness of the gate, by which they should enter, he having set the example before them.
744                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              And he said unto the children of men: Follow thou me. Wherefore, my beloved brethren, can we follow Jesus save we shall be willing to keep the commandments of the Father?
745                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               And the Father said: Repent ye, repent ye, and be baptized in the name of my Beloved Son.
746                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        And also, the voice of the Son came unto me, saying: He that is baptized in my name, to him will the Father give the Holy Ghost, like unto me; wherefore, follow me, and do the things which ye have seen me do.
747                                                                                    Wherefore, my beloved brethren, I know that if ye shall follow the Son, with full purpose of heart, acting no hypocrisy and no deception before God, but with real intent, repenting of your sins, witnessing unto the Father that ye are willing to take upon you the name of Christ, by baptism--yea, by following your Lord and your Savior down into the water, according to his word, behold, then shall ye receive the Holy Ghost; yea, then cometh the baptism of fire and of the Holy Ghost; and then can ye speak with the tongue of angels, and shout praises unto the Holy One of Israel.
748                                                                                                                                                                                                                                But, behold, my beloved brethren, thus came the voice of the Son unto me, saying: After ye have repented of your sins, and witnessed unto the Father that ye are willing to keep my commandments, by the baptism of water, and have received the baptism of fire and of the Holy Ghost, and can speak with a new tongue, yea, even with the tongue of angels, and after this should deny me, it would have been better for you that ye had not known me.
749                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  And I heard a voice from the Father, saying: Yea, the words of my Beloved are true and faithful. He that endureth to the end, the same shall be saved.
750                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      And now, my beloved brethren, I know by this that unless a man shall endure to the end, in following the example of the Son of the living God, he cannot be saved.
751                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        Wherefore, do the things which I have told you I have seen that your Lord and your Redeemer should do; for, for this cause have they been shown unto me, that ye might know the gate by which ye should enter. For the gate by which ye should enter is repentance and baptism by water; and then cometh a remission of your sins by fire and by the Holy Ghost.
752                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       And then are ye in this strait and narrow path which leads to eternal life; yea, ye have entered in by the gate; ye have done according to the commandments of the Father and the Son; and ye have received the Holy Ghost, which witnesses of the Father and the Son, unto the fulfilling of the promise which he hath made, that if ye entered in by the way ye should receive.
753                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 And now, my beloved brethren, after ye have gotten into this strait and narrow path, I would ask if all is done? Behold, I say unto you, Nay; for ye have not come thus far save it were by the word of Christ with unshaken faith in him, relying wholly upon the merits of him who is mighty to save.
754                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Wherefore, ye must press forward with a steadfastness in Christ, having a perfect brightness of hope, and a love of God and of all men. Wherefore, if ye shall press forward, feasting upon the word of Christ, and endure to the end, behold, thus saith the Father: Ye shall have eternal life.
755                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               And now, behold, my beloved brethren, this is the way; and there is none other way nor name given under heaven whereby man can be saved in the kingdom of God. And now, behold, this is the doctrine of Christ, and the only and true doctrine of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost, which is one God, without end. Amen.
756                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               And now, behold, my beloved brethren, I suppose that ye ponder somewhat in your hearts concerning that which ye should do after ye have entered in by the way. But, behold, why do ye ponder these things in your hearts?
757                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Do ye not remember that I said unto you that after ye had received the Holy Ghost ye could speak with the tongue of angels? And now, how could ye speak with the tongue of angels save it were by the Holy Ghost?
758                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         Angels speak by the power of the Holy Ghost; wherefore, they speak the words of Christ. Wherefore, I said unto you, feast upon the words of Christ; for behold, the words of Christ will tell you all things what ye should do.
759                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             Wherefore, now after I have spoken these words, if ye cannot understand them it will be because ye ask not, neither do ye knock; wherefore, ye are not brought into the light, but must perish in the dark.
760                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   For behold, again I say unto you that if ye will enter in by the way, and receive the Holy Ghost, it will show unto you all things what ye should do.
761                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  Behold, this is the doctrine of Christ, and there will be no more doctrine given until after he shall manifest himself unto you in the flesh. And when he shall manifest himself unto you in the flesh, the things which he shall say unto you shall ye observe to do.
762                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                And now I, Nephi, cannot say more; the Spirit stoppeth mine utterance, and I am left to mourn because of the unbelief, and the wickedness, and the ignorance, and the stiffneckedness of men; for they will not search knowledge, nor understand great knowledge, when it is given unto them in plainness, even as plain as word can be.
763                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 And now, my beloved brethren, I perceive that ye ponder still in your hearts; and it grieveth me that I must speak concerning this thing. For if ye would hearken unto the Spirit which teacheth a man to pray ye would know that ye must pray; for the evil spirit teacheth not a man to pray, but teacheth him that he must not pray.

765                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             And now I, Nephi, cannot write all the things which were taught among my people; neither am I mighty in writing, like unto speaking; for when a man speaketh by the power of the Holy Ghost the power of the Holy Ghost carrieth it unto the hearts of the children of men.
766                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                But behold, there are many that harden their hearts against the Holy Spirit, that it hath no place in them; wherefore, they cast many things away which are written and esteem them as things of naught.
767                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 But I, Nephi, have written what I have written, and I esteem it as of great worth, and especially unto my people. For I pray continually for them by day, and mine eyes water my pillow by night, because of them; and I cry unto my God in faith, and I know that he will hear my cry.
768                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       And I know that the Lord God will consecrate my prayers for the gain of my people. And the words which I have written in weakness will be made strong unto them; for it persuadeth them to do good; it maketh known unto them of their fathers; and it speaketh of Jesus, and persuadeth them to believe in him, and to endure to the end, which is life eternal.
769                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            And it speaketh harshly against sin, according to the plainness of the truth; wherefore, no man will be angry at the words which I have written save he shall be of the spirit of the devil.
770                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    I glory in plainness; I glory in truth; I glory in my Jesus, for he hath redeemed my soul from hell.
771                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     I have charity for my people, and great faith in Christ that I shall meet many souls spotless at his judgment-seat.
772                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          I have charity for the Jew--I say Jew, because I mean them from whence I came.
773                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            I also have charity for the Gentiles. But behold, for none of these can I hope except they shall be reconciled unto Christ, and enter into the narrow gate, and walk in the strait path which leads to life, and continue in the path until the end of the day of probation.
774                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  And now, my beloved brethren, and also Jew, and all ye ends of the earth, hearken unto these words and believe in Christ; and if ye believe not in these words believe in Christ. And if ye shall believe in Christ ye will believe in these words, for they are the words of Christ, and he hath given them unto me; and they teach all men that they should do good.
775                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  And if they are not the words of Christ, judge ye--for Christ will show unto you, with power and great glory, that they are his words, at the last day; and you and I shall stand face to face before his bar; and ye shall know that I have been commanded of him to write these things, notwithstanding my weakness.
776                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        And I pray the Father in the name of Christ that many of us, if not all, may be saved in his kingdom at that great and last day.
777                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              And now, my beloved brethren, all those who are of the house of Israel, and all ye ends of the earth, I speak unto you as the voice of one crying from the dust: Farewell until that great day shall come.
778                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  And you that will not partake of the goodness of God, and respect the words of the Jews, and also my words, and the words which shall proceed forth out of the mouth of the Lamb of God, behold, I bid you an everlasting farewell, for these words shall condemn you at the last day.
779                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 For what I seal on earth, shall be brought against you at the judgment bar; for thus hath the Lord commanded me, and I must obey. Amen.

12                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  And it came to pass that he cried mightily unto the Lord all that day; and behold, the voice of the Lord came unto him, saying:
13                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               Lift up your head and be of good cheer; for behold, the time is at hand, and on this night shall the sign be given, and on the morrow come I into the world, to show unto the world that I will fulfil all that which I have caused to be spoken by the mouth of my holy prophets.
14                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             Behold, I come unto my own, to fulfil all things which I have made known unto the children of men from the foundation of the world, and to do the will, both of the Father and of the Son--of the Father because of me, and of the Son because of my flesh. And behold, the time is at hand, and this night shall the sign be given.
15                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             And it came to pass that the words which came unto Nephi were fulfilled, according as they had been spoken; for behold, at the going down of the sun there was no darkness; and the people began to be astonished because there was no darkness when the night came.
16                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 And there were many, who had not believed the words of the prophets, who fell to the earth and became as if they were dead, for they knew that the great plan of destruction which they had laid for those who believed in the words of the prophets had been frustrated; for the sign which had been given was already at hand.
17                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               And they began to know that the Son of God must shortly appear; yea, in fine, all the people upon the face of the whole earth from the west to the east, both in the land north and in the land south, were so exceedingly astonished that they fell to the earth.
18                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   For they knew that the prophets had testified of these things for many years, and that the sign which had been given was already at hand; and they began to fear because of their iniquity and their unbelief.
19                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         And it came to pass that there was no darkness in all that night, but it was as light as though it was mid-day. And it came to pass that the sun did rise in the morning again, according to its proper order; and they knew that it was the day that the Lord should be born, because of the sign which had been given.
20                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    And it had come to pass, yea, all things, every whit, according to the words of the prophets.
21                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      And it came to pass also that a new star did appear, according to the word.
22                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       And it came to pass that from this time forth there began to be lyings sent forth among the people, by Satan, to harden their hearts, to the intent that they might not believe in those signs and wonders which they had seen; but notwithstanding these lyings and deceivings the more part of the people did believe, and were converted unto the Lord.
23                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        And it came to pass that Nephi went forth among the people, and also many others, baptizing unto repentance, in the which there was a great remission of sins. And thus the people began again to have peace in the land.
24                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  And there were no contentions, save it were a few that began to preach, endeavoring to prove by the scriptures that it was no more expedient to observe the law of Moses. Now in this thing they did err, having not understood the scriptures.
25                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    But it came to pass that they soon became converted, and were convinced of the error which they were in, for it was made known unto them that the law was not yet fulfilled, and that it must be fulfilled in every whit; yea, the word came unto them that it must be fulfilled; yea, that one jot or tittle should not pass away till it should all be fulfilled; therefore in this same year were they brought to a knowledge of their error and did confess their faults.
26                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           And thus the ninety and second year did pass away, bringing glad tidings unto the people because of the signs which did come to pass, according to the words of the prophecy of all the holy prophets.
27                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              And it came to pass that the ninety and third year did also pass away in peace, save it were for the Gadianton robbers, who dwelt upon the mountains, who did infest the land; for so strong were their holds and their secret places that the people could not overpower them; therefore they did commit many murders, and did do much slaughter among the people.
28                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          And it came to pass that in the ninety and fourth year they began to increase in a great degree, because there were many dissenters of the Nephites who did flee unto them, which did cause much sorrow unto those Nephites who did remain in the land.
29                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  And there was also a cause of much sorrow among the Lamanites; for behold, they had many children who did grow up and began to wax strong in years, that they became for themselves, and were led away by some who were Zoramites, by their lyings and their flattering words, to join those Gadianton robbers.
30                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       And thus were the Lamanites afflicted also, and began to decrease as to their faith and righteousness, because of the wickedness of the rising generation.
31                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    And it came to pass that thus passed away the ninety and fifth year also, and the people began to forget those signs and wonders which they had heard, and began to be less and less astonished at a sign or a wonder from heaven, insomuch that they began to be hard in their hearts, and blind in their minds, and began to disbelieve all which they had heard and seen--
32                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  Imagining up some vain thing in their hearts, that it was wrought by men and by the power of the devil, to lead away and deceive the hearts of the people; and thus did Satan get possession of the hearts of the people again, insomuch that he did blind their eyes and lead them away to believe that the doctrine of Christ was a foolish and a vain thing.

34                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 And thus did pass away the ninety and sixth year; and also the ninety and seventh year; and also the ninety and eighth year; and also the ninety and ninth year;
35                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                And also an hundred years had passed away since the days of Mosiah, who was king over the people of the Nephites.
36                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        And six hundred and nine years had passed away since Lehi left Jerusalem.
37                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               And nine years had passed away from the time when the sign was given, which was spoken of by the prophets, that Christ should come into the world.
38                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Now the Nephites began to reckon their time from this period when the sign was given, or from the coming of Christ; therefore, nine years had passed away.
39                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  And Nephi, who was the father of Nephi, who had the charge of the records, did not return to the land of Zarahemla, and could nowhere be found in all the land.

41                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            And it came to pass in the thirteenth year there began to be wars and contentions throughout all the land; for the Gadianton robbers had become so numerous, and did slay so many of the people, and did lay waste so many cities, and did spread so much death and carnage throughout the land, that it became expedient that all the people, both the Nephites and the Lamanites, should take up arms against them.
42                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Therefore, all the Lamanites who had become converted unto the Lord did unite with their brethren, the Nephites, and were compelled, for the safety of their lives and their women and their children, to take up arms against those Gadianton robbers, yea, and also to maintain their rights, and the privileges of their church and of their worship, and their freedom and their liberty.

45                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         And their curse was taken from them, and their skin became white like unto the Nephites;
46                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        And their young men and their daughters became exceedingly fair, and they were numbered among the Nephites, and were called Nephites. And thus ended the thirteenth year.
47                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           And it came to pass in the commencement of the fourteenth year, the war between the robbers and the people of Nephi did continue and did become exceedingly sore; nevertheless, the people of Nephi did gain some advantage of the robbers, insomuch that they did drive them back out of their lands into the mountains and into their secret places.
48                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       And thus ended the fourteenth year. And in the fifteenth year they did come forth against the people of Nephi; and because of the wickedness of the people of Nephi, and their many contentions and dissensions, the Gadianton robbers did gain many advantages over them.
49                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         And thus ended the fifteenth year, and thus were the people in a state of many afflictions; and the sword of destruction did hang over them, insomuch that they were about to be smitten down by it, and this because of their iniquity.
50                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            And now it came to pass that in the sixteenth year from the coming of Christ, Lachoneus, the governor of the land, received an epistle from the leader and the governor of this band of robbers; and these were the words which were written, saying:
51                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             Lachoneus, most noble and chief governor of the land, behold, I write this epistle unto you, and do give unto you exceedingly great praise because of your firmness, and also the firmness of your people, in maintaining that which ye suppose to be your right and liberty; yea, ye do stand well, as if ye were supported by the hand of a god, in the defence of your liberty, and your property, and your country, or that which ye do call so.
52                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               And it seemeth a pity unto me, most noble Lachoneus, that ye should be so foolish and vain as to suppose that ye can stand against so many brave men who are at my command, who do now at this time stand in their arms, and do await with great anxiety for the word--Go down upon the Nephites and destroy them.
53                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                And I, knowing of their unconquerable spirit, having proved them in the field of battle, and knowing of their everlasting hatred towards you because of the many wrongs which ye have done unto them, therefore if they should come down against you they would visit you with utter destruction.
54                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Therefore I have written this epistle, sealing it with mine own hand, feeling for your welfare, because of your firmness in that which ye believe to be right, and your noble spirit in the field of battle.
55                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 Therefore I write unto you, desiring that ye would yield up unto this my people, your cities, your lands, and your possessions, rather than that they should visit you with the sword and that destruction should come upon you.
56                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          Or in other words, yield yourselves up unto us, and unite with us and become acquainted with our secret works, and become our brethren that ye may be like unto us--not our slaves, but our brethren and partners of all our substance.

59                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  And I write this epistle unto you, Lachoneus, and I hope that ye will deliver up your lands and your possessions, without the shedding of blood, that this my people may recover their rights and government, who have dissented away from you because of your wickedness in retaining from them their rights of government, and except ye do this, I will avenge their wrongs. I am Giddianhi.

61                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            Now behold, this Lachoneus, the governor, was a just man, and could not be frightened by the demands and the threatenings of a robber; therefore he did not hearken to the epistle of Giddianhi, the governor of the robbers, but he did cause that his people should cry unto the Lord for strength against the time that the robbers should come down against them.
62                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              Yea, he sent a proclamation among all the people, that they should gather together their women, and their children, their flocks and their herds, and all their substance, save it were their land, unto one place.
63                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     And he caused that fortifications should be built round about them, and the strength thereof should be exceedingly great. And he caused that armies, both of the Nephites and of the Lamanites, or of all them who were numbered among the Nephites, should be placed as guards round about to watch them, and to guard them from the robbers day and night.
64                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         Yea, he said unto them: As the Lord liveth, except ye repent of all your iniquities, and cry unto the Lord, ye will in no wise be delivered out of the hands of those Gadianton robbers.
65                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              And so great and marvelous were the words and prophecies of Lachoneus that they did cause fear to come upon all the people; and they did exert themselves in their might to do according to the words of Lachoneus.
66                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             And it came to pass that Lachoneus did appoint chief captains over all the armies of the Nephites, to command them at the time that the robbers should come down out of the wilderness against them.
67                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              Now the chiefest among all the chief captains and the great commander of all the armies of the Nephites was appointed, and his name was Gidgiddoni.
68                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              Now it was the custom among all the Nephites to appoint for their chief captains, (save it were in their times of wickedness) some one that had the spirit of revelation and also prophecy; therefore, this Gidgiddoni was a great prophet among them, as also was the chief judge.
69                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Now the people said unto Gidgiddoni: Pray unto the Lord, and let us go up upon the mountains and into the wilderness, that we may fall upon the robbers and destroy them in their own lands.
70                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 But Gidgiddoni saith unto them: The Lord forbid; for if we should go up against them the Lord would deliver us into their hands; therefore we will prepare ourselves in the center of our lands, and we will gather all our armies together, and we will not go against them, but we will wait till they shall come against us; therefore as the Lord liveth, if we do this he will deliver them into our hands.
71                                                                                                                                                                                                                    And it came to pass in the seventeenth year, in the latter end of the year, the proclamation of Lachoneus had gone forth throughout all the face of the land, and they had taken their horses, and their chariots, and their cattle, and all their flocks, and their herds, and their grain, and all their substance, and did march forth by thousands and by tens of thousands, until they had all gone forth to the place which had been appointed that they should gather themselves together, to defend themselves against their enemies.
72                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             And the land which was appointed was the land of Zarahemla, and the land which was between the land Zarahemla and the land Bountiful, yea, to the line which was between the land Bountiful and the land Desolation.
73                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  And there were a great many thousand people who were called Nephites, who did gather themselves together in this land. Now Lachoneus did cause that they should gather themselves together in the land southward, because of the great curse which was upon the land northward.
74                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           And they did fortify themselves against their enemies; and they did dwell in one land, and in one body, and they did fear the words which had been spoken by Lachoneus, insomuch that they did repent of all their sins; and they did put up their prayers unto the Lord their God, that he would deliver them in the time that their enemies should come down against them to battle.
75                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       And they were exceedingly sorrowful because of their enemies. And Gidgiddoni did cause that they should make weapons of war of every kind, and they should be strong with armor, and with shields, and with bucklers, after the manner of his instruction.
76                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    And it came to pass that in the latter end of the eighteenth year those armies of robbers had prepared for battle, and began to come down and to sally forth from the hills, and out of the mountains, and the wilderness, and their strongholds, and their secret places, and began to take possession of the lands, both which were in the land south and which were in the land north, and began to take possession of all the lands which had been deserted by the Nephites, and the cities which had been left desolate.
77                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     But behold, there were no wild beasts nor game in those lands which had been deserted by the Nephites, and there was no game for the robbers save it were in the wilderness.
78                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          And the robbers could not exist save it were in the wilderness, for the want of food; for the Nephites had left their lands desolate, and had gathered their flocks and their herds and all their substance, and they were in one body.
79                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             Therefore, there was no chance for the robbers to plunder and to obtain food, save it were to come up in open battle against the Nephites; and the Nephites being in one body, and having so great a number, and having reserved for themselves provisions, and horses and cattle, and flocks of every kind, that they might subsist for the space of seven years, in the which time they did hope to destroy the robbers from off the face of the land; and thus the eighteenth year did pass away.
80                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              And it came to pass that in the nineteenth year Giddianhi found that it was expedient that he should go up to battle against the Nephites, for there was no way that they could subsist save it were to plunder and rob and murder.
81                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             And they durst not spread themselves upon the face of the land insomuch that they could raise grain, lest the Nephites should come upon them and slay them; therefore Giddianhi gave commandment unto his armies that in this year they should go up to battle against the Nephites.
82                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         And it came to pass that they did come up to battle; and it was in the sixth month; and behold, great and terrible was the day that they did come up to battle; and they were girded about after the manner of robbers; and they had a lamb-skin about their loins, and they were dyed in blood, and their heads were shorn, and they had head-plates upon them; and great and terrible was the appearance of the armies of Giddianhi, because of their armor, and because of their being dyed in blood.
83                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            And it came to pass that the armies of the Nephites, when they saw the appearance of the army of Giddianhi, had all fallen to the earth, and did lift their cries to the Lord their God, that he would spare them and deliver them out of the hands of their enemies.
84                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  And it came to pass that when the armies of Giddianhi saw this they began to shout with a loud voice, because of their joy, for they had supposed that the Nephites had fallen with fear because of the terror of their armies.
85                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             But in this thing they were disappointed, for the Nephites did not fear them; but they did fear their God and did supplicate him for protection; therefore, when the armies of Giddianhi did rush upon them they were prepared to meet them; yea, in the strength of the Lord they did receive them.
86                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               And the battle commenced in this the sixth month; and great and terrible was the battle thereof, yea, great and terrible was the slaughter thereof, insomuch that there never was known so great a slaughter among all the people of Lehi since he left Jerusalem.
87                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              And notwithstanding the threatenings and the oaths which Giddianhi had made, behold, the Nephites did beat them, insomuch that they did fall back from before them.
88                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       And it came to pass that Gidgiddoni commanded that his armies should pursue them as far as the borders of the wilderness, and that they should not spare any that should fall into their hands by the way; and thus they did pursue them and did slay them, to the borders of the wilderness, even until they had fulfilled the commandment of Gidgiddoni.
89                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       And it came to pass that Giddianhi, who had stood and fought with boldness, was pursued as he fled; and being weary because of his much fighting he was overtaken and slain. And thus was the end of Giddianhi the robber.

And it came to pass that this nineteenth year did pass away, and the robbers did not come again to battle; neither did they come again in the twentieth year.
91                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        And in the twenty and first year they did not come up to battle, but they came up on all sides to lay siege round about the people of Nephi; for they did suppose that if they should cut off the people of Nephi from their lands, and should hem them in on every side, and if they should cut them off from all their outward privileges, that they could cause them to yield themselves up according to their wishes.
92                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  Now they had appointed unto themselves another leader, whose name was Zemnarihah; therefore it was Zemnarihah that did cause that this siege should take place.
93                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   But behold, this was an advantage to the Nephites; for it was impossible for the robbers to lay siege sufficiently long to have any effect upon the Nephites, because of their much provision which they had laid up in store,
94                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               And because of the scantiness of provisions among the robbers; for behold, they had nothing save it were meat for their subsistence, which meat they did obtain in the wilderness;
95                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               And it came to pass that the wild game became scarce in the wilderness insomuch that the robbers were about to perish with hunger.

97                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              And thus it became the desire of the people of Zemnarihah to withdraw from their design, because of the great destruction which came upon them by night and by day.
98                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            And it came to pass that Zemnarihah did give command unto his people that they should withdraw themselves from the siege, and march into the furthermost parts of the land northward.
99                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      And now, Gidgiddoni being aware of their design, and knowing of their weakness because of the want of food, and the great slaughter which had been made among them, therefore he did send out his armies in the night-time, and did cut off the way of their retreat, and did place his armies in the way of their retreat.
100                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                And this did they do in the night-time, and got on their march beyond the robbers, so that on the morrow, when the robbers began their march, they were met by the armies of the Nephites both in their front and in their rear.

And all these things were done by command of Gidgiddoni.

103                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    And their leader, Zemnarihah, was taken and hanged upon a tree, yea, even upon the top thereof until he was dead. And when they had hanged him until he was dead they did fell the tree to the earth, and did cry with a loud voice, saying:
104                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             May the Lord preserve his people in righteousness and in holiness of heart, that they may cause to be felled to the earth all who shall seek to slay them because of power and secret combinations, even as this man hath been felled to the earth.
105                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        And they did rejoice and cry again with one voice, saying: May the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, protect this people in righteousness, so long as they shall call on the name of their God for protection.
106                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  And it came to pass that they did break forth, all as one, in singing, and praising their God for the great thing which he had done for them, in preserving them from falling into the hands of their enemies.
107                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             Yea, they did cry: Hosanna to the Most High God. And they did cry: Blessed be the name of the Lord God Almighty, the Most High God.

112                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        And now it came to pass that when they had taken all the robbers prisoners, insomuch that none did escape who were not slain, they did cast their prisoners into prison, and did cause the word of God to be preached unto them; and as many as would repent of their sins and enter into a covenant that they would murder no more were set at liberty.

114                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            And thus they did put an end to all those wicked, and secret, and abominable combinations, in the which there was so much wickedness, and so many murders committed.

116                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          And there had many things transpired which, in the eyes of some, would be great and marvelous; nevertheless, they cannot all be written in this book; yea, this book cannot contain even a hundredth part of what was done among so many people in the space of twenty and five years;
117                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            But behold there are records which do contain all the proceedings of this people; and a shorter but true account was given by Nephi.
118                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Therefore I have made my record of these things according to the record of Nephi, which was engraven on the plates which were called the plates of Nephi.
119                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               And behold, I do make the record on plates which I have made with mine own hands.
120                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      And behold, I am called Mormon, being called after the land of Mormon, the land in which Alma did establish the church among the people, yea, the first church which was established among them after their transgression.

I have been called of him to declare his word among his people, that they might have everlasting life.

123                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Yea, a small record of that which hath taken place from the time that Lehi left Jerusalem, even down until the present time.
124                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            Therefore I do make my record from the accounts which have been given by those who were before me, until the commencement of my day;
125                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 And then I do make a record of the things which I have seen with mine own eyes.
126                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               And I know the record which I make to be a just and a true record; nevertheless there are many things which, according to our language, we are not able to write.
127                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 And now I make an end of my saying, which is of myself, and proceed to give my account of the things which have been before me.
128                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 I am Mormon, and a pure descendant of Lehi. I have reason to bless my God and my Savior Jesus Christ, that he brought our fathers out of the land of Jerusalem, (and no one knew it save it were himself and those whom he brought out of that land) and that he hath given me and my people so much knowledge unto the salvation of our souls.
129                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      Surely he hath blessed the house of Jacob, and hath been merciful unto the seed of Joseph.
130                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  And insomuch as the children of Lehi have kept his commandments he hath blessed them and prospered them according to his word.
131                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Yea, and surely shall he again bring a remnant of the seed of Joseph to the knowledge of the Lord their God.

Amen.

136                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               And it came to pass that they had not eaten up all their provisions; therefore they did take with them all that they had not devoured, of all their grain of every kind, and their gold, and their silver, and all their precious things, and they did return to their own lands and their possessions, both on the north and on the south, both on the land northward and on the land southward.
137                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             And they granted unto those robbers who had entered into a covenant to keep the peace of the land, who were desirous to remain Lamanites, lands, according to their numbers, that they might have, with their labors, wherewith to subsist upon; and thus they did establish peace in all the land.
138                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                And they began again to prosper and to wax great; and the twenty and sixth and seventh years passed away, and there was great order in the land; and they had formed their laws according to equity and justice.

142                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         And there were many highways cast up, and many roads made, which led from city to city, and from land to land, and from place to place.

145                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            For there were many merchants in the land, and also many lawyers, and many officers.
146                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   And the people began to be distinguished by ranks, according to their riches and their chances for learning; yea, some were ignorant because of their poverty, and others did receive great learning because of their riches.
147                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          Some were lifted up in pride, and others were exceedingly humble; some did return railing for railing, while others would receive railing and persecution and all manner of afflictions, and would not turn and revile again, but were humble and penitent before God.
148                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             And thus there became a great inequality in all the land, insomuch that the church began to be broken up; yea, insomuch that in the thirtieth year the church was broken up in all the land save it were among a few of the Lamanites who were converted unto the true faith; and they would not depart from it, for they were firm, and steadfast, and immovable, willing with all diligence to keep the commandments of the Lord.
149                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             Now the cause of this iniquity of the people was this--Satan had great power, unto the stirring up of the people to do all manner of iniquity, and to the puffing them up with pride, tempting them to seek for power, and authority, and riches, and the vain things of the world.
150                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           And thus Satan did lead away the hearts of the people to do all manner of iniquity; therefore they had enjoyed peace but a few years.

152                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                Now they did not sin ignorantly, for they knew the will of God concerning them, for it had been taught unto them; therefore they did wilfully rebel against God.
153                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               And now it was in the days of Lachoneus, the son of Lachoneus, for Lachoneus did fill the seat of his father and did govern the people that year.
154                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        And there began to be men inspired from heaven and sent forth, standing among the people in all the land, preaching and testifying boldly of the sins and iniquities of the people, and testifying unto them concerning the redemption which the Lord would make for his people, or in other words, the resurrection of Christ; and they did testify boldly of his death and sufferings.
155                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Now there were many of the people who were exceedingly angry because of those who testified of these things; and those who were angry were chiefly the chief judges, and they who had been high priests and lawyers; yea, all those who were lawyers were angry with those who testified of these things.
156                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             Now there was no lawyer nor judge nor high priest that could have power to condemn any one to death save their condemnation was signed by the governor of the land.
157                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Now there were many of those who testified of the things pertaining to Christ who testified boldly, who were taken and put to death secretly by the judges, that the knowledge of their death came not unto the governor of the land until after their death.
158                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                Now behold, this was contrary to the laws of the land, that any man should be put to death except they had power from the governor of the land--
159                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Therefore a complaint came up unto the land of Zarahemla, to the governor of the land, against these judges who had condemned the prophets of the Lord unto death, not according to the law.
160                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               Now it came to pass that they were taken and brought up before the judge, to be judged of the crime which they had done, according to the law which had been given by the people.
161                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           Now it came to pass that those judges had many friends and kindreds; and the remainder, yea, even almost all the lawyers and the high priests, did gather themselves together, and unite with the kindreds of those judges who were to be tried according to the law.
162                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 And they did enter into a covenant one with another, yea, even into that covenant which was given by them of old, which covenant was given and administered by the devil, to combine against all righteousness.
163                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        Therefore they did combine against the people of the Lord, and enter into a covenant to destroy them, and to deliver those who were guilty of murder from the grasp of justice, which was about to be administered according to the law.
164                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       And they did set at defiance the law and the rights of their country; and they did covenant one with another to destroy the governor, and to establish a king over the land, that the land should no more be at liberty but should be subject unto kings.
165                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        Now behold, I will show unto you that they did not establish a king over the land; but in this same year, yea, the thirtieth year, they did destroy upon the judgment-seat, yea, did murder the chief judge of the land.
166                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       And the people were divided one against another; and they did separate one from another into tribes, every man according to his family and his kindred and friends; and thus they did destroy the government of the land.

169                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      Now all this was done, and there were no wars as yet among them; and all this iniquity had come upon the people because they did yield themselves unto the power of Satan.

171                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          And they did cause a great contention in the land, insomuch that the more righteous part of the people had nearly all become wicked; yea, there were but few righteous men among them.
172                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          And thus six years had not passed away since the more part of the people had turned from their righteousness, like the dog to his vomit, or like the sow to her wallowing in the mire.
173                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Now this secret combination, which had brought so great iniquity upon the people, did gather themselves together, and did place at their head a man whom they did call Jacob;
174                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         And they did call him their king; therefore he became a king over this wicked band; and he was one of the chiefest who had given his voice against the prophets who testified of Jesus.
175                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                And it came to pass that they were not so strong in number as the tribes of the people, who were united together save it were their leaders did establish their laws, every one according to his tribe; nevertheless they were enemies; notwithstanding they were not a righteous people, yet they were united in the hatred of those who had entered into a covenant to destroy the government.
176                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             Therefore, Jacob seeing that their enemies were more numerous than they, he being the king of the band, therefore he commanded his people that they should take their flight into the northernmost part of the land, and there build up unto themselves a kingdom, until they were joined by dissenters, (for he flattered them that there would be many dissenters) and they become sufficiently strong to contend with the tribes of the people; and they did so.
177                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       And so speedy was their march that it could not be impeded until they had gone forth out of the reach of the people. And thus ended the thirtieth year; and thus were the affairs of the people of Nephi.
178                                               And it came to pass in the thirty and first year that they were divided into tribes, every man according to his family, kindred and friends; nevertheless they had come to an agreement that they would not go to war one with another; but they were not united as to their laws, and their manner of government, for they were established according to the minds of those who were their chiefs and their leaders. But they did establish very strict laws that one tribe should not trespass against another, insomuch that in some degree they had peace in the land; nevertheless, their hearts were turned from the Lord their God, and they did stone the prophets and did cast them out from among them.
179                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        And it came to pass that Nephi--having been visited by angels and also the voice of the Lord, therefore having seen angels, and being eye-witness, and having had power given unto him that he might know concerning the ministry of Christ, and also being eye-witness to their quick return from righteousness unto their wickedness and abominations;
180                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Therefore, being grieved for the hardness of their hearts and the blindness of their minds--went forth among them in that same year, and began to testify, boldly, repentance and remission of sins through faith on the Lord Jesus Christ.
181                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    And he did minister many things unto them; and all of them cannot be written, and a part of them would not suffice, therefore they are not written in this book. And Nephi did minister with power and with great authority.

183                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                And in the name of Jesus did he cast out devils and unclean spirits; and even his brother did he raise from the dead, after he had been stoned and suffered death by the people.
184                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            And the people saw it, and did witness of it, and were angry with him because of his power; and he did also do many more miracles, in the sight of the people, in the name of Jesus.
185                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         And it came to pass that the thirty and first year did pass away, and there were but few who were converted unto the Lord; but as many as were converted did truly signify unto the people that they had been visited by the power and Spirit of God, which was in Jesus Christ, in whom they believed.
186                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            And as many as had devils cast out from them, and were healed of their sicknesses and their infirmities, did truly manifest unto the people that they had been wrought upon by the Spirit of God, and had been healed; and they did show forth signs also and did do some miracles among the people.
187                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             Thus passed away the thirty and second year also. And Nephi did cry unto the people in the commencement of the thirty and third year; and he did preach unto them repentance and remission of sins.
188                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  Now I would have you to remember also, that there were none who were brought unto repentance who were not baptized with water.
189                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Therefore, there were ordained of Nephi, men unto this ministry, that all such as should come unto them should be baptized with water, and this as a witness and a testimony before God, and unto the people, that they had repented and received a remission of their sins.
190                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      And there were many in the commencement of this year that were baptized unto repentance; and thus the more part of the year did pass away.
191                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 And now it came to pass that according to our record, and we know our record to be true, for behold, it was a just man who did keep the record--for he truly did many miracles in the name of Jesus; and there was not any man who could do a miracle in the name of Jesus save he were cleansed every whit from his iniquity--
192                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      And now it came to pass, if there was no mistake made by this man in the reckoning of our time, the thirty and third year had passed away;

205                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            And there were some cities which remained; but the damage thereof was exceedingly great, and there were many in them who were slain.

207                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           And thus the face of the whole earth became deformed, because of the tempests, and the thunderings, and the lightnings, and the quaking of the earth.
208                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   And behold, the rocks were rent in twain; they were broken up upon the face of the whole earth, insomuch that they were found in broken fragments, and in seams and in cracks, upon all the face of the land.
209                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      And it came to pass that when the thunderings, and the lightnings, and the storm, and the tempest, and the quakings of the earth did cease--for behold, they did last for about the space of three hours; and it was said by some that the time was greater; nevertheless, all these great and terrible things were done in about the space of three hours--and then behold, there was darkness upon the face of the land.

211                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              And there could be no light, because of the darkness, neither candles, neither torches; neither could there be fire kindled with their fine and exceedingly dry wood, so that there could not be any light at all;
212                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        And there was not any light seen, neither fire, nor glimmer, neither the sun, nor the moon, nor the stars, for so great were the mists of darkness which were upon the face of the land.
213                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  And it came to pass that it did last for the space of three days that there was no light seen; and there was great mourning and howling and weeping among all the people continually; yea, great were the groanings of the people, because of the darkness and the great destruction which had come upon them.
214                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     And in one place they were heard to cry, saying: O that we had repented before this great and terrible day, and then would our brethren have been spared, and they would not have been burned in that great city Zarahemla.
215                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               And in another place they were heard to cry and mourn, saying: O that we had repented before this great and terrible day, and had not killed and stoned the prophets, and cast them out; then would our mothers and our fair daughters, and our children have been spared, and not have been buried up in that great city Moronihah. And thus were the howlings of the people great and terrible.

217                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  Wo, wo, wo unto this people; wo unto the inhabitants of the whole earth except they shall repent; for the devil laugheth, and his angels rejoice, because of the slain of the fair sons and daughters of my people; and it is because of their iniquity and abominations that they are fallen!
218                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         Behold, that great city Zarahemla have I burned with fire, and the inhabitants thereof.
219                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                And behold, that great city Moroni have I caused to be sunk in the depths of the sea, and the inhabitants thereof to be drowned.
220                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  And behold, that great city Moronihah have I covered with earth, and the inhabitants thereof, to hide their iniquities and their abominations from before my face, that the blood of the prophets and the saints shall not come any more unto me against them.
221                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                And behold, the city of Gilgal have I caused to be sunk, and the inhabitants thereof to be buried up in the depths of the earth;
222                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      Yea, and the city of Onihah and the inhabitants thereof, and the city of Mocum and the inhabitants thereof, and the city of Jerusalem and the inhabitants thereof; and waters have I caused to come up in the stead thereof, to hide their wickedness and abominations from before my face, that the blood of the prophets and the saints shall not come up any more unto me against them.
223                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     And behold, the city of Gadiandi, and the city of Gadiomnah, and the city of Jacob, and the city of Gimgimno, all these have I caused to be sunk, and made hills and valleys in the places thereof; and the inhabitants thereof have I buried up in the depths of the earth, to hide their wickedness and abominations from before my face, that the blood of the prophets and the saints should not come up any more unto me against them.
224                                                                                                                                                                                                        And behold, that great city Jacobugath, which was inhabited by the people of king Jacob, have I caused to be burned with fire because of their sins and their wickedness, which was above all the wickedness of the whole earth, because of their secret murders and combinations; for it was they that did destroy the peace of my people and the government of the land; therefore I did cause them to be burned, to destroy them from before my face, that the blood of the prophets and the saints should not come up unto me any more against them.
225                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     And behold, the city of Laman, and the city of Josh, and the city of Gad, and the city of Kishkumen, have I caused to be burned with fire, and the inhabitants thereof, because of their wickedness in casting out the prophets, and stoning those whom I did send to declare unto them concerning their wickedness and their abominations.
226                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     And because they did cast them all out, that there were none righteous among them, I did send down fire and destroy them, that their wickedness and abominations might be hid from before my face, that the blood of the prophets and the saints whom I sent among them might not cry unto me from the ground against them.
227                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     And many great destructions have I caused to come upon this land, and upon this people, because of their wickedness and their abominations.
228                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              O all ye that are spared because ye were more righteous than they, will ye not now return unto me, and repent of your sins, and be converted, that I may heal you?
229                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         Yea, verily I say unto you, if ye will come unto me ye shall have eternal life. Behold, mine arm of mercy is extended towards you, and whosoever will come, him will I receive; and blessed are those who come unto me.

I created the heavens and the earth, and all things that in them are. I was with the Father from the beginning. I am in the Father, and the Father in me; and in me hath the Father glorified his name.

And the scriptures concerning my coming are fulfilled.
232                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       And as many as have received me, to them have I given to become the sons of God; and even so will I to as many as shall believe on my name, for behold, by me redemption cometh, and in me is the law of Moses fulfilled.
233                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      I am the light and the life of the world. I am Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the end.
234                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              And ye shall offer up unto me no more the shedding of blood; yea, your sacrifices and your burnt offerings shall be done away, for I will accept none of your sacrifices and your burnt offerings.
235                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          And ye shall offer for a sacrifice unto me a broken heart and a contrite spirit. And whoso cometh unto me with a broken heart and a contrite spirit, him will I baptize with fire and with the Holy Ghost, even as the Lamanites, because of their faith in me at the time of their conversion, were baptized with fire and with the Holy Ghost, and they knew it not.
236                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              Behold, I have come unto the world to bring redemption unto the world, to save the world from sin.
237                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           Therefore, whoso repenteth and cometh unto me as a little child, him will I receive, for of such is the kingdom of God. Behold, for such I have laid down my life, and have taken it up again; therefore repent, and come unto me ye ends of the earth, and be saved.
238                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               And now behold, it came to pass that all the people of the land did hear these sayings, and did witness of it. And after these sayings there was silence in the land for the space of many hours;
239                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          For so great was the astonishment of the people that they did cease lamenting and howling for the loss of their kindred which had been slain; therefore there was silence in all the land for the space of many hours.
240                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  And it came to pass that there came a voice again unto the people, and all the people did hear, and did witness of it, saying:
241                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    O ye people of these great cities which have fallen, who are descendants of Jacob, yea, who are of the house of Israel, how oft have I gathered you as a hen gathereth her chickens under her wings, and have nourished you.
242                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  And again, how oft would I have gathered you as a hen gathereth her chickens under her wings, yea, O ye people of the house of Israel, who have fallen; yea, O ye people of the house of Israel, ye that dwell at Jerusalem, as ye that have fallen; yea, how oft would I have gathered you as a hen gathereth her chickens, and ye would not.
243                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            O ye house of Israel whom I have spared, how oft will I gather you as a hen gathereth her chickens under her wings, if ye will repent and return unto me with full purpose of heart.
244                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             But if not, O house of Israel, the places of your dwellings shall become desolate until the time of the fulfilling of the covenant to your fathers.
245                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                And now it came to pass that after the people had heard these words, behold, they began to weep and howl again because of the loss of their kindred and friends.
246                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        And it came to pass that thus did the three days pass away. And it was in the morning, and the darkness dispersed from off the face of the land, and the earth did cease to tremble, and the rocks did cease to rend, and the dreadful groanings did cease, and all the tumultuous noises did pass away.
247                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           And the earth did cleave together again, that it stood; and the mourning, and the weeping, and the wailing of the people who were spared alive did cease; and their mourning was turned into joy, and their lamentations into the praise and thanksgiving unto the Lord Jesus Christ, their Redeemer.
248                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               And thus far were the scriptures fulfilled which had been spoken by the prophets.
249                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     And it was the more righteous part of the people who were saved, and it was they who received the prophets and stoned them not; and it was they who had not shed the blood of the saints, who were spared--
250                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              And they were spared and were not sunk and buried up in the earth; and they were not drowned in the depths of the sea; and they were not burned by fire, neither were they fallen upon and crushed to death; and they were not carried away in the whirlwind; neither were they overpowered by the vapor of smoke and of darkness.
251                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              And now, whoso readeth, let him understand; he that hath the scriptures, let him search them, and see and behold if all these deaths and destructions by fire, and by smoke, and by tempests, and by whirlwinds, and by the opening of the earth to receive them, and all these things are not unto the fulfilling of the prophecies of many of the holy prophets.
252                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                Behold, I say unto you, Yea, many have testified of these things at the coming of Christ, and were slain because they testified of these things.
253                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        Yea, the prophet Zenos did testify of these things, and also Zenock spake concerning these things, because they testified particularly concerning us, who are the remnant of their seed.

And behold, are not we a remnant of the seed of Joseph? And these things which testify of us, are they not written upon the plates of brass which our father Lehi brought out of Jerusalem?

256                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            Showing his body unto them, and ministering unto them; and an account of his ministry shall be given hereafter. Therefore for this time I make an end of my sayings.
257                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      And now it came to pass that there were a great multitude gathered together, of the people of Nephi, round about the temple which was in the land Bountiful; and they were marveling and wondering one with another, and were showing one to another the great and marvelous change which had taken place.
258                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    And they were also conversing about this Jesus Christ, of whom the sign had been given concerning his death.
259                                                                                                                                                                                                           And it came to pass that while they were thus conversing one with another, they heard a voice as if it came out of heaven; and they cast their eyes round about, for they understood not the voice which they heard; and it was not a harsh voice, neither was it a loud voice; nevertheless, and notwithstanding it being a small voice it did pierce them that did hear to the center, insomuch that there was no part of their frame that it did not cause to quake; yea, it did pierce them to the very soul, and did cause their hearts to burn.
260                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                And it came to pass that again they heard the voice, and they understood it not.
261                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  And again the third time they did hear the voice, and did open their ears to hear it; and their eyes were towards the sound thereof; and they did look steadfastly towards heaven, from whence the sound came.
262                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               And behold, the third time they did understand the voice which they heard; and it said unto them:
263                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                Behold my Beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased, in whom I have glorified my name--hear ye him.
264                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  And it came to pass, as they understood they cast their eyes up again towards heaven; and behold, they saw a Man descending out of heaven; and he was clothed in a white robe; and he came down and stood in the midst of them; and the eyes of the whole multitude were turned upon him, and they durst not open their mouths, even one to another, and wist not what it meant, for they thought it was an angel that had appeared unto them.
265                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         And it came to pass that he stretched forth his hand and spake unto the people, saying:

270                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            Arise and come forth unto me, that ye may thrust your hands into my side, and also that ye may feel the prints of the nails in my hands and in my feet, that ye may know that I am the God of Israel, and the God of the whole earth, and have been slain for the sins of the world.
271                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      And it came to pass that the multitude went forth, and thrust their hands into his side, and did feel the prints of the nails in his hands and in his feet; and this they did do, going forth one by one until they had all gone forth, and did see with their eyes and did feel with their hands, and did know of a surety and did bear record, that it was he, of whom it was written by the prophets, that should come.
272                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    And when they had all gone forth and had witnessed for themselves, they did cry out with one accord, saying:
273                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            Hosanna! Blessed be the name of the Most High God! And they did fall down at the feet of Jesus, and did worship him.
274                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                And it came to pass that he spake unto Nephi (for Nephi was among the multitude) and he commanded him that he should come forth.
275                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        And Nephi arose and went forth, and bowed himself before the Lord and did kiss his feet.
276                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             And the Lord commanded him that he should arise. And he arose and stood before him.
277                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       And the Lord said unto him: I give unto you power that ye shall baptize this people when I am again ascended into heaven.

And he said unto them: On this wise shall ye baptize; and there shall be no disputations among you.

And there shall be no disputations among you, as there have hitherto been; neither shall there be disputations among you concerning the points of my doctrine, as there have hitherto been.

297                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Therefore, go forth unto this people, and declare the words which I have spoken, unto the ends of the earth.
298 And it came to pass that when Jesus had spoken these words unto Nephi, and to those who had been called, (now the number of them who had been called, and received power and authority to baptize, was twelve) and behold, he stretched forth his hand unto the multitude, and cried unto them, saying: Blessed are ye if ye shall give heed unto the words of these twelve whom I have chosen from among you to minister unto you, and to be your servants; and unto them I have given power that they may baptize you with water; and after that ye are baptized with water, behold, I will baptize you with fire and with the Holy Ghost; therefore blessed are ye if ye shall believe in me and be baptized, after that ye have seen me and know that I am.
299                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    And again, more blessed are they who shall believe in your words because that ye shall testify that ye have seen me, and that ye know that I am. Yea, blessed are they who shall believe in your words, and come down into the depths of humility and be baptized, for they shall be visited with fire and with the Holy Ghost, and shall receive a remission of their sins.

Behold, ye have the commandments before you, and the law is fulfilled.

319                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          But I say unto you, that whosoever is angry with his brother shall be in danger of his judgment. And whosoever shall say to his brother, Raca, shall be in danger of the council; and whosoever shall say, Thou fool, shall be in danger of hell fire.

And while ye are in prison can ye pay even one senine? Verily, verily, I say unto you, Nay.

325                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         But I say unto you, that whosoever looketh on a woman, to lust after her, hath committed adultery already in his heart.
326                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            Behold, I give unto you a commandment, that ye suffer none of these things to enter into your heart;
327                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     For it is better that ye should deny yourselves of these things, wherein ye will take up your cross, than that ye should be cast into hell.
328                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        It hath been written, that whosoever shall put away his wife, let him give her a writing of divorcement.
329                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Verily, verily, I say unto you, that whosoever shall put away his wife, saving for the cause of fornication, causeth her to commit adultery; and whoso shall marry her who is divorced committeth adultery.

345                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              Therefore I would that ye should be perfect even as I, or your Father who is in heaven is perfect.
346                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Verily, verily, I say that I would that ye should do alms unto the poor; but take heed that ye do not your alms before men to be seen of them; otherwise ye have no reward of your Father who is in heaven.
347                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            Therefore, when ye shall do your alms do not sound a trumpet before you, as will hypocrites do in the synagogues and in the streets, that they may have glory of men. Verily I say unto you, they have their reward.
348                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  But when thou doest alms let not thy left hand know what thy right hand doeth;
349                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         That thine alms may be in secret; and thy Father who seeth in secret, himself shall reward thee openly.
350                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    And when thou prayest thou shalt not do as the hypocrites, for they love to pray, standing in the synagogues and in the corners of the streets, that they may be seen of men. Verily I say unto you, they have their reward.

352                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    But when ye pray, use not vain repetitions, as the heathen, for they think that they shall be heard for their much speaking.

If, therefore, the light that is in thee be darkness, how great is that darkness!

Ye cannot serve God and Mammon.

For behold, ye are they whom I have chosen to minister unto this people. Therefore I say unto you, take no thought for your life, what ye shall eat, or what ye shall drink; nor yet for your body, what ye shall put on. Is not the life more than meat, and the body than raiment?

Are ye not much better than they?

Consider the lilies of the field how they grow; they toil not, neither do they spin;

Sufficient is the day unto the evil thereof.

Look unto me, and endure to the end, and ye shall live; for unto him that endureth to the end will I give eternal life.

And this is the law and the prophets, for they truly testified of me.

423                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        That other sheep I have which are not of this fold; them also I must bring, and they shall hear my voice; and there shall be one fold, and one shepherd.
424                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           And now, because of stiffneckedness and unbelief they understood not my word; therefore I was commanded to say no more of the Father concerning this thing unto them.
425                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   But, verily, I say unto you that the Father hath commanded me, and I tell it unto you, that ye were separated from among them because of their iniquity; therefore it is because of their iniquity that they know not of you.
426                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     And verily, I say unto you again that the other tribes hath the Father separated from them; and it is because of their iniquity that they know not of them.
427                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 And verily I say unto you, that ye are they of whom I said: Other sheep I have which are not of this fold; them also I must bring, and they shall hear my voice; and there shall be one fold, and one shepherd.

431                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        And verily, verily, I say unto you that I have other sheep, which are not of this land, neither of the land of Jerusalem, neither in any parts of that land round about whither I have been to minister.
432                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   For they of whom I speak are they who have not as yet heard my voice; neither have I at any time manifested myself unto them.
433                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       But I have received a commandment of the Father that I shall go unto them, and that they shall hear my voice, and shall be numbered among my sheep, that there may be one fold and one shepherd; therefore I go to show myself unto them.
434                                                                                                 And I command you that ye shall write these sayings after I am gone, that if it so be that my people at Jerusalem, they who have seen me and been with me in my ministry, do not ask the Father in my name, that they may receive a knowledge of you by the Holy Ghost, and also of the other tribes whom they know not of, that these sayings which ye shall write shall be kept and shall be manifested unto the Gentiles, that through the fulness of the Gentiles, the remnant of their seed, who shall be scattered forth upon the face of the earth because of their unbelief, may be brought in, or may be brought to a knowledge of me, their Redeemer.
435                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  And then will I gather them in from the four quarters of the earth; and then will I fulfil the covenant which the Father hath made unto all the people of the house of Israel.
436                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       And blessed are the Gentiles, because of their belief in me, in and of the Holy Ghost, which witnesses unto them of me and of the Father.
437                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Behold, because of their belief in me, saith the Father, and because of the unbelief of you, O house of Israel, in the latter day shall the truth come unto the Gentiles, that the fulness of these things shall be made known unto them.
438                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    But wo, saith the Father, unto the unbelieving of the Gentiles--for notwithstanding they have come forth upon the face of this land, and have scattered my people who are of the house of Israel; and my people who are of the house of Israel have been cast out from among them, and have been trodden under feet by them;
439                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            And because of the mercies of the Father unto the Gentiles, and also the judgments of the Father upon my people who are of the house of Israel, verily, verily, I say unto you, that after all this, and I have caused my people who are of the house of Israel to be smitten, and to be afflicted, and to be slain, and to be cast out from among them, and to become hated by them, and to become a hiss and a byword among them--
440                                                                                                                 And thus commandeth the Father that I should say unto you: At that day when the Gentiles shall sin against my gospel, and shall reject the fulness of my gospel, and shall be lifted up in the pride of their hearts above all nations, and above all the people of the whole earth, and shall be filled with all manner of lyings, and of deceits, and of mischiefs, and all manner of hypocrisy, and murders, and priestcrafts, and whoredoms, and of secret abominations; and if they shall do all those things, and shall reject the fulness of my gospel, behold, saith the Father, I will bring the fulness of my gospel from among them.

448                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              Thy watchmen shall lift up the voice; with the voice together shall they sing, for they shall see eye to eye when the Lord shall bring again Zion.

Bring them hither. Have ye any that are lame, or blind, or halt, or maimed, or leprous, or that are withered, or that are deaf, or that are afflicted in any manner? Bring them hither and I will heal them, for I have compassion upon you; my bowels are filled with mercy.

459                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     And it came to pass that when he had thus spoken, all the multitude, with one accord, did go forth with their sick and their afflicted, and their lame, and with their blind, and with their dumb, and with all them that were afflicted in any manner; and he did heal them every one as they were brought forth unto him.

461                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             And it came to pass that he commanded that their little children should be brought.
462                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      So they brought their little children and set them down upon the ground round about him, and Jesus stood in the midst; and the multitude gave way till they had all been brought unto him.

467                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    And no tongue can speak, neither can there be written by any man, neither can the hearts of men conceive so great and marvelous things as we both saw and heard Jesus speak; and no one can conceive of the joy which filled our souls at the time we heard him pray for us unto the Father.

And now behold, my joy is full.

And it shall be a testimony unto the Father that ye do always remember me. And if ye do always remember me ye shall have my Spirit to be with you.

And if ye do always remember me ye shall have my Spirit to be with you.

And if ye shall always do these things blessed are ye, for ye are built upon my rock.

Behold I am the light; I have set an example for you.

Behold I am the light which ye shall hold up--that which ye have seen me do. Behold ye see that I have prayed unto the Father, and ye all have witnessed.

501                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             And now it came to pass that when Jesus had spoken these words, he turned his eyes again upon the disciples whom he had chosen, and said unto them:
502                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      Behold verily, verily, I say unto you, I give unto you another commandment, and then I must go unto my Father that I may fulfil other commandments which he hath given me.
503                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               And now behold, this is the commandment which I give unto you, that ye shall not suffer any one knowingly to partake of my flesh and blood unworthily, when ye shall minister it;
504                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  For whoso eateth and drinketh my flesh and blood unworthily eateth and drinketh damnation to his soul; therefore if ye know that a man is unworthy to eat and drink of my flesh and blood ye shall forbid him.
505                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          Nevertheless, ye shall not cast him out from among you, but ye shall minister unto him and shall pray for him unto the Father, in my name; and if it so be that he repenteth and is baptized in my name, then shall ye receive him, and shall minister unto him of my flesh and blood.
506                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            But if he repent not he shall not be numbered among my people, that he may not destroy my people, for behold I know my sheep, and they are numbered.
507                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        Nevertheless, ye shall not cast him out of your synagogues, or your places of worship, for unto such shall ye continue to minister; for ye know not but what they will return and repent, and come unto me with full purpose of heart, and I shall heal them; and ye shall be the means of bringing salvation unto them.
508                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Therefore, keep these sayings which I have commanded you that ye come not under condemnation; for wo unto him whom the Father condemneth.
509                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               And I give you these commandments because of the disputations which have been among you. And blessed are ye if ye have no disputations among you.

512                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            And the multitude heard not the words which he spake, therefore they did not bear record; but the disciples bare record that he gave them power to give the Holy Ghost. And I will show unto you hereafter that this record is true.
513                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      And it came to pass that when Jesus had touched them all, there came a cloud and overshadowed the multitude that they could not see Jesus.
514                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 And while they were overshadowed he departed from them, and ascended into heaven. And the disciples saw and did bear record that he ascended again into heaven.

517                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             Yea, and even all the night it was noised abroad concerning Jesus; and insomuch did they send forth unto the people that there were many, yea, an exceedingly great number, did labor exceedingly all that night, that they might be on the morrow in the place where Jesus should show himself unto the multitude.
518                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   And it came to pass that on the morrow, when the multitude was gathered together, behold, Nephi and his brother whom he had raised from the dead, whose name was Timothy, and also his son, whose name was Jonas, and also Mathoni, and Mathonihah, his brother, and Kumen, and Kumenonhi, and Jeremiah, and Shemnon, and Jonas, and Zedekiah, and Isaiah--now these were the names of the disciples whom Jesus had chosen--and it came to pass that they went forth and stood in the midst of the multitude.

535                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         Father, I pray thee that thou wilt give the Holy Ghost unto all them that shall believe in their words.

542                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         Father, I thank thee that thou hast purified those whom I have chosen, because of their faith, and I pray for them, and also for them who shall believe on their words, that they may be purified in me, through faith on their words, even as they are purified in me.

546                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     And tongue cannot speak the words which he prayed, neither can be written by man the words which he prayed.
547                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    And the multitude did hear and do bear record; and their hearts were open and they did understand in their hearts the words which he prayed.
548                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            Nevertheless, so great and marvelous were the words which he prayed that they cannot be written, neither can they be uttered by man.
549                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      And it came to pass that when Jesus had made an end of praying he came again to the disciples, and said unto them: So great faith have I never seen among all the Jews; wherefore I could not show unto them so great miracles, because of their unbelief.

And he commanded them that they should not cease to pray in their hearts.
552                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         And he commanded them that they should arise and stand up upon their feet. And they arose up and stood upon their feet.
553                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 And it came to pass that he brake bread again and blessed it, and gave to the disciples to eat.

557                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               But he truly gave unto them bread to eat, and also wine to drink.
558                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            And he said unto them: He that eateth this bread eateth of my body to his soul; and he that drinketh of this wine drinketh of my blood to his soul; and his soul shall never hunger nor thirst, but shall be filled.

562                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     And verily, verily, I say unto you, that when they shall be fulfilled then is the fulfilling of the covenant which the Father hath made unto his people, O house of Israel.
563                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       And then shall the remnants, which shall be scattered abroad upon the face of the earth, be gathered in from the east and from the west, and from the south and from the north; and they shall be brought to the knowledge of the Lord their God, who hath redeemed them.

And thou shalt beat in pieces many people; and I will consecrate their gain unto the Lord, and their substance unto the Lord of the whole earth. And behold, I am he who doeth it.

And the powers of heaven shall be in the midst of this people; yea, even I will be in the midst of you.

And it shall come to pass that every soul who will not hear that prophet shall be cut off from among the people.

576                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            The Father having raised me up unto you first, and sent me to bless you in turning away every one of you from his iniquities; and this because ye are the children of the covenant--
577                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             And after that ye were blessed then fulfilleth the Father the covenant which he made with Abraham, saying: In thy seed shall all the kindreds of the earth be blessed--unto the pouring out of the Holy Ghost through me upon the Gentiles, which blessing upon the Gentiles shall make them mighty above all, unto the scattering of my people, O house of Israel.

Nevertheless, when they shall have received the fulness of my gospel, then if they shall harden their hearts against me I will return their iniquities upon their own heads, saith the Father.

595                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       So shall he sprinkle many nations; the kings shall shut their mouths at him, for that which had not been told them shall they see; and that which they had not heard shall they consider.

Then shall this covenant which the Father hath covenanted with his people be fulfilled; and then shall Jerusalem be inhabited again with my people, and it shall be the land of their inheritance.
597                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    And verily I say unto you, I give unto you a sign, that ye may know the time when these things shall be about to take place--that I shall gather in, from their long dispersion, my people, O house of Israel, and shall establish again among them my Zion;
598                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  And behold, this is the thing which I will give unto you for a sign--for verily I say unto you that when these things which I declare unto you, and which I shall declare unto you hereafter of myself, and by the power of the Holy Ghost which shall be given unto you of the Father, shall be made known unto the Gentiles that they may know concerning this people who are a remnant of the house of Jacob, and concerning this my people who shall be scattered by them;
599                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          Verily, verily, I say unto you, when these things shall be made known unto them of the Father, and shall come forth of the Father, from them unto you;
600                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 For it is wisdom in the Father that they should be established in this land, and be set up as a free people by the power of the Father, that these things might come forth from them unto a remnant of your seed, that the covenant of the Father may be fulfilled which he hath covenanted with his people, O house of Israel;

602                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            For thus it behooveth the Father that it should come forth from the Gentiles, that he may show forth his power unto the Gentiles, for this cause that the Gentiles, if they will not harden their hearts, that they may repent and come unto me and be baptized in my name and know of the true points of my doctrine, that they may be numbered among my people, O house of Israel;
603                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   And when these things come to pass that thy seed shall begin to know these things--it shall be a sign unto them, that they may know that the work of the Father hath already commenced unto the fulfilling of the covenant which he hath made unto the people who are of the house of Israel.
604                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            And when that day shall come, it shall come to pass that kings shall shut their mouths; for that which had not been told them shall they see; and that which they had not heard shall they consider.
605                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      For in that day, for my sake shall the Father work a work, which shall be a great and a marvelous work among them; and there shall be among them those who will not believe it, although a man shall declare it unto them.
606                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 But behold, the life of my servant shall be in my hand; therefore they shall not hurt him, although he shall be marred because of them. Yet I will heal him, for I will show unto them that my wisdom is greater than the cunning of the devil.
607                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  Therefore it shall come to pass that whosoever will not believe in my words, who am Jesus Christ, which the Father shall cause him to bring forth unto the Gentiles, and shall give unto him power that he shall bring them forth unto the Gentiles, (it shall be done even as Moses said) they shall be cut off from among my people who are of the covenant.
608                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      And my people who are a remnant of Jacob shall be among the Gentiles, yea, in the midst of them as a lion among the beasts of the forest, as a young lion among the flocks of sheep, who, if he go through both treadeth down and teareth in pieces, and none can deliver.
609                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Their hand shall be lifted up upon their adversaries, and all their enemies shall be cut off.

611                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  And I will cut off the cities of thy land, and throw down all thy strongholds;

617                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         And I will execute vengeance and fury upon them, even as upon the heathen, such as they have not heard.
618                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        But if they will repent and hearken unto my words, and harden not their hearts, I will establish my church among them, and they shall come in unto the covenant and be numbered among this the remnant of Jacob, unto whom I have given this land for their inheritance;
619                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              And they shall assist my people, the remnant of Jacob, and also as many of the house of Israel as shall come, that they may build a city, which shall be called the New Jerusalem.
620                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  And then shall they assist my people that they may be gathered in, who are scattered upon all the face of the land, in unto the New Jerusalem.

622                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                And then shall the work of the Father commence at that day, even when this gospel shall be preached among the remnant of this people. Verily I say unto you, at that day shall the work of the Father commence among all the dispersed of my people, yea, even the tribes which have been lost, which the Father hath led away out of Jerusalem.

Search the prophets, for many there be that testify of these things.

649                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         And it came to pass that he said unto Nephi: Bring forth the record which ye have kept.
650                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    And when Nephi had brought forth the records, and laid them before him, he cast his eyes upon them and said:
651                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        Verily I say unto you, I commanded my servant Samuel, the Lamanite, that he should testify unto this people, that at the day that the Father should glorify his name in me that there were many saints who should arise from the dead, and should appear unto many, and should minister unto them. And he said unto them: Was it not so?
652                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    And his disciples answered him and said: Yea, Lord, Samuel did prophesy according to thy words, and they were all fulfilled.
653                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            And Jesus said unto them: How be it that ye have not written this thing, that many saints did arise and appear unto many and did minister unto them?
654                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 And it came to pass that Nephi remembered that this thing had not been written.
655                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         And it came to pass that Jesus commanded that it should be written; therefore it was written according as he commanded.
656                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  And now it came to pass that when Jesus had expounded all the scriptures in one, which they had written, he commanded them that they should teach the things which he had expounded unto them.
657                                                                                                                                                                                         And it came to pass that he commanded them that they should write the words which the Father had given unto Malachi, which he should tell unto them. And it came to pass that after they were written he expounded them. And these are the words which he did tell unto them, saying: Thus said the Father unto Malachi--Behold, I will send my messenger, and he shall prepare the way before me, and the Lord whom ye seek shall suddenly come to his temple, even the messenger of the covenant, whom ye delight in; behold, he shall come, saith the Lord of Hosts.

For he is like a refiner's fire, and like fuller's soap.

Yet ye have robbed me. But ye say: Wherein have we robbed thee? In tithes and offerings.

685                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    If they be good, to the resurrection of everlasting life; and if they be evil, to the resurrection of damnation; being on a parallel, the one on the one hand and the other on the other hand, according to the mercy, and the justice, and the holiness which is in Christ, who was before the world began.

687                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               But behold the plates of Nephi do contain the more part of the things which he taught the people.

691                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        Behold, I was about to write them, all which were engraven upon the plates of Nephi, but the Lord forbade it, saying: I will try the faith of my people.
692                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  Therefore I, Mormon, do write the things which have been commanded me of the Lord. And now I, Mormon, make an end of my sayings, and proceed to write the things which have been commanded me.

For by this name shall ye be called at the last day;

For if a church be called in Moses' name then it be Moses' church; or if it be called in the name of a man then it be the church of a man; but if it be called in my name then it is my church, if it so be that they are built upon my gospel.

711                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    And if it so be that the church is built upon my gospel then will the Father show forth his own works in it.

715                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      And my Father sent me that I might be lifted up upon the cross; and after that I had been lifted up upon the cross, that I might draw all men unto me, that as I have been lifted up by men even so should men be lifted up by the Father, to stand before me, to be judged of their works, whether they be good or whether they be evil--
716                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        And for this cause have I been lifted up; therefore, according to the power of the Father I will draw all men unto me, that they may be judged according to their works.

Therefore, what manner of men ought ye to be? Verily I say unto you, even as I am.

And verily I say unto you, whatsoever things ye shall ask the Father in my name shall be given unto you.

732                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  Behold, I would that ye should understand; for I mean them who are now alive of this generation; and none of them are lost; and in them I have fulness of joy.
733                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               But behold, it sorroweth me because of the fourth generation from this generation, for they are led away captive by him even as was the son of perdition; for they will sell me for silver and for gold, and for that which moth doth corrupt and which thieves can break through and steal. And in that day will I visit them, even in turning their works upon their own heads.
734                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  And it came to pass that when Jesus had ended these sayings he said unto his disciples: Enter ye in at the strait gate; for strait is the gate, and narrow is the way that leads to life, and few there be that find it; but wide is the gate, and broad the way which leads to death, and many there be that travel therein, until the night cometh, wherein no man can work.
735                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            And it came to pass when Jesus had said these words, he spake unto his disciples, one by one, saying unto them: What is it that ye desire of me, after that I am gone to the Father?
736                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    And they all spake, save it were three, saying: We desire that after we have lived unto the age of man, that our ministry, wherein thou hast called us, may have an end, that we may speedily come unto thee in thy kingdom.
737                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          And he said unto them: Blessed are ye because ye desired this thing of me; therefore, after that ye are seventy and two years old ye shall come unto me in my kingdom; and with me ye shall find rest.
738                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 And when he had spoken unto them, he turned himself unto the three, and said unto them: What will ye that I should do unto you, when I am gone unto the Father?
739                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              And they sorrowed in their hearts, for they durst not speak unto him the thing which they desired.
740                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              And he said unto them: Behold, I know your thoughts, and ye have desired the thing which John, my beloved, who was with me in my ministry, before that I was lifted up by the Jews, desired of me.

744                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      And for this cause ye shall have fulness of joy; and ye shall sit down in the kingdom of my Father; yea, your joy shall be full, even as the Father hath given me fulness of joy; and ye shall be even as I am, and I am even as the Father; and the Father and I are one;
745                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           And the Holy Ghost beareth record of the Father and me; and the Father giveth the Holy Ghost unto the children of men, because of me.

748                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               And it was forbidden them that they should utter; neither was it given unto them power that they could utter the things which they saw and heard;
749                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           And whether they were in the body or out of the body, they could not tell; for it did seem unto them like a transfiguration of them, that they were changed from this body of flesh into an immortal state, that they could behold the things of God.
750                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         But it came to pass that they did again minister upon the face of the earth; nevertheless they did not minister of the things which they had heard and seen, because of the commandment which was given them in heaven.
751                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               And now, whether they were mortal or immortal, from the day of their transfiguration, I know not;
752                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             But this much I know, according to the record which hath been given--they did go forth upon the face of the land, and did minister unto all the people, uniting as many to the church as would believe in their preaching; baptizing them, and as many as were baptized did receive the Holy Ghost.
753                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      And they were cast into prison by them who did not belong to the church. And the prisons could not hold them, for they were rent in twain.

769                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                And it would be better for them if they had not been born. For do ye suppose that ye can get rid of the justice of an offended God, who hath been trampled under feet of men, that thereby salvation might come?
770                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          And now behold, as I spake concerning those whom the Lord hath chosen, yea, even three who were caught up into the heavens, that I knew not whether they were cleansed from mortality to immortality--
771                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    But behold, since I wrote, I have inquired of the Lord, and he hath made it manifest unto me that there must needs be a change wrought upon their bodies, or else it needs be that they must taste of death;
772                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  Therefore, that they might not taste of death there was a change wrought upon their bodies, that they might not suffer pain nor sorrow save it were for the sins of the world.
773                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      Now this change was not equal to that which shall take place at the last day; but there was a change wrought upon them, insomuch that Satan could have no power over them, that he could not tempt them; and they were sanctified in the flesh, that they were holy, and that the powers of the earth could not hold them.
774                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             And in this state they were to remain until the judgment day of Christ; and at that day they were to receive a greater change, and to be received into the kingdom of the Father to go no more out, but to dwell with God eternally in the heavens.
775                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         And now behold, I say unto you that when the Lord shall see fit, in his wisdom, that these sayings shall come unto the Gentiles according to his word, then ye may know that the covenant which the Father hath made with the children of Israel, concerning their restoration to the lands of their inheritance, is already beginning to be fulfilled.
776                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               And ye may know that the words of the Lord, which have been spoken by the holy prophets, shall all be fulfilled; and ye need not say that the Lord delays his coming unto the children of Israel.

781                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           Yea, and wo unto him that shall say at that day, to get gain, that there can be no miracle wrought by Jesus Christ; for he that doeth this shall become like unto the son of perdition, for whom there was no mercy, according to the word of Christ!
782                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             Yea, and ye need not any longer hiss, nor spurn, nor make game of the Jews, nor any of the remnant of the house of Israel; for behold, the Lord remembereth his covenant unto them, and he will do unto them according to that which he hath sworn.
783                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      Therefore ye need not suppose that ye can turn the right hand of the Lord unto the left, that he may not execute judgment unto the fulfilling of the covenant which he hath made unto the house of Israel.

785                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 Turn, all ye Gentiles, from your wicked ways; and repent of your evil doings, of your lyings and deceivings, and of your whoredoms, and of your secret abominations, and your idolatries, and of your murders, and your priestcrafts, and your envyings, and your strifes, and from all your wickedness and abominations, and come unto me, and be baptized in my name, that ye may receive a remission of your sins, and be filled with the Holy Ghost, that ye may be numbered with my people who are of the house of Israel.
